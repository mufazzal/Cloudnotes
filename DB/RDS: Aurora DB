Aurora is In house RDB product from AWS.
and so Amazon provide many special feature with this DB. This DB give almost all the thing that MYSQL and Postgress gave but also add lot other things.
Even some of the tool design for MYSQL and Postgress ccan be used with Aurora

Below are the exclusive Aurora features:-
  Back Tracking DB:-
    If you enable this feature in Aurora DB then you can backtrack the DB clusted to the point in time easily in few seconds. 
    In other RDS point in time recovery take lot of time.
    When you enable it then you need to set the Time provide the MAx Window time for backtracking. max value is 72 hour.  
  High Avialibility:-
    By default Aurora keep the 6 copies of data. they spread in 3 AZ wirh each has 2 nodes so 3*2 = 6.
    So no need to to have the MultiAz here as data is alreday fault tolerant higly available.
    Non aurora RDS take some time in case of failover and move to secondery storage[only if Multi-AZ is on]
    but Aurora do it whithine a minute only.
 Read Replica:-
    RDS provide max 5 replica. Aurora give you 15.
    Replication process is also way faster in aurora.
    Read Replica Load Balancing:-
      In Aurora you can create a load balancer to distribute the reading load across the read replicas.
      In RDS there is no way to do this.

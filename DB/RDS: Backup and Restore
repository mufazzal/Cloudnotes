 Automated-back-up:-
  Here you will set two imp things
  Backup Window:-
    The time window when the back up should be taken. EG: 24 hour
  Retenstion priode:-
    How long you wants to keep the back up. EG: 35 days
   EG: Take back up after every 24 hour and keep this back up file for next 35 days.

   The snapshot of the back up will be shown at 
   RDS > snapshot
   you can see the type of the snapshot will be 'Automated'

 Restoring from back up :-
  1. for this simply select the DB > Action > restore point in time.
  2. Select time 
  3. choose DB identifier [must and should be non existubg one]
  4. chose other thing
  5. Done

  IMP: When back up is in progress then at that time DB will face some IOPS leg because backup process consume IOPS.

--------

Snapshot:-
  Other way to take the back up is via snap shot. This is totally manual process for backing up.
  to take it :-
    1. for this simply select the DB > Action > take snapshot
    2. type name
    3. save
    You will be able to see the snap in 'snapshot' page
   Restore :-
    1. got to snapshot
    2. Action > restore
    3. choose DB identifier [must and should be non existubg one]
    4. chose other thing
    5. Done


Snapshot vs Automated-back-up :-
  Simillarity - 
    1. Both are way to take back up and restore
    2. Whenever  you restore the DB from snapshot or from Automated-back-up, the process is very same
       and in both the DNS endpoint get changes. you have to choose the other identifier.
       So orignal.bala.blabal.aws.com  may changed to   snappy.bla.bla.aws.com
    3. For both of them the snapshot of back up will be visible at 'snapshot' page
   Diffrence :-
    1.  in Automated-back-up the back time and retention is configured, after that taking back is totally automatic proceess
        in snapshot you take a snap whenever you need. so here backing up is not automated with time
    2. The type of snapshot will ne 'manual' for one and 'automated' for other.

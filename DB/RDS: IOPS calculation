GP2 IOPS:-
	GP2 is useful when you do not know the load on your database. 
	The IOPS of GP2 disk depend on allocated disk size [not used disk szie]
	For higher storage allocation you will get more IOPS.
	
	Minimun IOPS you will get is 100 IOPS.
	So if your allocated storae is  < 33.33 GB then you will get 100 IOPS.
	after that you gate 3 additional IOPS for each 1 GB allocation.
	
	So performance of your RDS instance increase with allocated size.
	See table for detail:-	
		Storage				storage*3				IOPS allocated
		1							3								100
		5							15							100
		30						90							100
		33.33					100							100
		100						300							300
		200						600							600
		500						1500						1500
		1000[1TB]			3000						3000
		2TB						6000						6000
		5TB			 		 ~16000		 			 ~16000


What if you need more IOPS performance then allocated. 
In that case IOPS Credit comes in picture.
IOPS Credit:-
	When your RDS instance is created you will get the 5.4 million IOPS credit.
	This credit get used when limit of allocated IOPS reached for RDS instance.
	Now the IOPS balance will also start to accumlating for each second the RDS is up and running.
	So if	
		rate of accumlation > rate of depletion then you may face latency at some point of time as your all iops credit get finish
			and you stuck to baseline performance.
		rate of accumlation < rate of depletion	then you may be using more IOPS rate then allocated but yet system will remain healthy.
		
Provisioned IOPS:-
	IF you need the consistent IOPS capacity and do not want to rely on all those if and buts.
	Then simply use Provisionde IOPS. This will cost you high but give you consistent performance.
	You can select how much IOPS you need,

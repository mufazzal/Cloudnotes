DDB stream: you can use stream to analyze what happen to
DDB in last 24 hour. it has detail about CRUD operation 

DDB is nicely integrated with lambda.
you can set lambda trigger on stream event. once you do it
ttgen Cloudwatch set a polling mechanism in background
and triiger the lambda if new event or events prsent in stream.

its very much like SQS.

    AWS support two open source in-memory cache tecnique.
      1. MeMCached: for simpler one. 
      2. redis: for more refined and advance, its Multi AZ, can have back uo and restore, serrch and sort etc.
    The only advantage of mecached over redis is that it support multithreading
    
    
    Caching Stratagy:-
      Lazy Loading:-
        The data is loaded when user requetsed it. So only useful data is loaded not useless.
        but you can observe latency in case of cache miss.
      Write-through:-
        Data is updated in cache too if its updated in RDS.
        CAche can hve lot of useless data at a time.
        Latency is low as data is always in there.
       --> In both case the data will expire after TTL.

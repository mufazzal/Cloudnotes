Miti AZ:-
      If you enable this then, you will have two diffrent DB instance under the hood. one is primary and 
      other is secondry and copy of primary. AWS take care to keep the secondry in synch to primary.
      In case of any failover the secondery will becom the primary.
      When you choose the Multi AZ then, you can see the subnet group in connectivity detail od DBs aws page.
      In Multi AZ env there is two DB host, The primary and secondry.
      Primary handle all the traffic and answer it. For any write operation the wrote forst happen over prime one
      and then on sec one. after write on prime and sec both are successful, the user will be acknolaged with success
      otherwise with failure.
      IMP: The Multi AZ not at improve a bit of your performance. It do not handle any traffic. 
      Its only is to keep a secondry one ready in case of failover at primary one.
      On the contrary it actully increase the time for write operation on DB. bcoz now write has to perform on two 
      diffrent isolate host
      cost is also high.
      It give one additional advantage at back uo time, noe 
      taken from secondry not primary.
      Multi AZ and DNS :-
        In the Multi AZ DB the DNS play a major role, when the prime DB fails then its duty of DNS to resolve the 
        DNS name to proper working DB instance either prime or sec.
        Lets say you have a Multi AZ DB (mufdatabase) with End point is 
           'mufdatabase.c1eagwg2tuyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com'                 ....DNS_name1
        the DNS_name1 is DNS name but it does not have any IPv4 address attached to it.
        instead its just an entry in AWS DNS registery syatem which is mapped wth underneath EC2 instance.
        This DNS either resolve to prime or sec DB instance depends on the scenario.        
        Lets say two DB host (prim+sec) underneath this DB instance are
          ec2-35-172-176-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com   OR   35.172.176.105        
        And 
          ???????????
        In that ase the infra would be -
                                                                                  Prime
                                      |------------------------- ec2-35-172-176-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com
                                      |                                     OR   35.172.176.105
                                      |                                              . 
                                      |                                              .
       DNS_name1  --------------------                                               .
                                                                                     .
                                                                                     .
                                                                                     .
                                                                                    Sec
                                                                  ec2-34.200.143.202-compute-1.amazonaws.com
                                                                           OR   34.200.143.202         
        
        
        In a good time the DNS_name1 will point to 'ec2-35-172-176-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com'. 
        you can test it via nslookup or host commande in ubuntu and windows.
        if you rum command 
          >> host mufdatabase.c1eagwg2tuyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
        You will get 
        Name: ec2-35-172-176-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        IP:   35.172.176.105 
        Aliases: mufdatabase.c1eagwg2tuyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
        
        the dotted vertical link between prime and sec DB in the ultra low latency connection which keep the 
        sec in synch with prime.
      What happen at Multi AZ Failover - 
        When a failover occure in prime one, The aws DNS will do neccesary changes and start pointing to sec one 
        against the DNS_name1. Now sec will start behaving like prime
        onece the failled DB instane is up again, it remain as sec and stay the up to date with prime one.
        Now the infra would be -
                                                                                            
                                                                                    sec
                                                               ec2-35-172-176-105.compute-1.amazonaws.com
                                                                           OR   35.172.176.105
                                                                                    . 
                                                                                    .
       DNS_name1  --------------------                                              .
                                      |                                             .
                                      |                                             .
                                      |                                             .
                                      |                                            Prime
                                      |------------------------ ec2-34-200-143-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com
                                                                           OR   34.200.143.202         
        
        
        

     Now if you rum command 
          >> host mufdatabase.c1eagwg2tuyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
        You will get 
        Name: ec2-34-200-143-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com
        IP:   34.200.143.202
        Aliases: mufdatabase.c1eagwg2tuyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
      
      
    IPs of Multi AZ RDS:- For the DNS name of RDS endpoint(DNS_Name1) there is no IP, instead DNS_Name1 is nothing but an alias
    the real endpoint is actully those prime or sec Ec2 instance.
    The layer of alias (DNS_Name1) is added to build the feature od multi AZ support.
    The ailas could either point to prime or sec, depending on if failover happen or not.
    
    If you rum thi command
    >> host ec2-34-200-143-202.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    the output will be-
       Name: ec2-34-200-143-202.compute-1.amazonaws.comhas 
       IP:   34.200.143.202

--
Multi AZ failover occure in below cases:-
  Storage/Network/Compute unit failure of Primary instance
  AZ failure

-----------
IF your Apps are caching the IP of DNS then make sure that you set TTL for this so that DNS IP will get invalidated after soe time.
otherwise failover will not reflected on your app.

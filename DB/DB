AWS give us the way to integrate RD(Relation Database) and NRD(No Relation Database) DB both

Supporting SQL DB:
  SQLSever
  ORACLE
  MySql
  PostgresSql
  Amazon Aurora : amazon itself
  MariaDb
  
  The AWS provide 'RDS' (Relation Database Service) for integration of RDB
  
  Key feature of RDS
  1. Multiple AZ: For disator at one AZ will save you from complete loss
      If anything happen then aws automatically rout to another AZ without even restarting anything
  2. Read Replica: for performance boost AWS keep multiple read only copy
      AWS write the one DB, and may keep multiple copy for fast reading
      
  NoSqlDB:-
  
    AWS provide its own NRD: DynamoDB
    
  Data Warehousing: 
    Database is a central comp of any app. so the production DB shopuld always be fast and swift to generate result of query.
    Generally application run the small queries on the DB but analytics work run very complex and time taking query.
    
    So for best practice we keep prod DB isolated from Analytics work
    For analytics we use another DB and system, Thats called data warehousing 
    
    AWS tool for Data warehousing: RedShift
    
    
  Caching: 
    AWS also provide a way to cache the DB in the memory. So retrive the data from memory instead of a disk
    this is mostly use for frequetly identical query (eg. Select * from todaysTop10Song)
    
    AWS tool for Caching: ElasticCache
    
    AWS support two open source in-memory cache tecnique.
    1. MeMCached
    2. redis
    
    
    RDB                 RDS
    NoSql               DnnamoDB
    Data Warehosing:    RedShift
    Cache:              ElasticCache

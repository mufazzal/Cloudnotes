Querying the DDB :- 
  Once authentiacation is successful the you can query the data via below code:-              
	var docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();
	var params = { TableName: "MufUser",  ...... };
	docClient.get(params, function(err, data) { console.log(err, data) });    
	Params here define that what the data you will get afetr the calling get function.
    
 There is three diffrent technique to read the data. for this you have to provide proper values in params
	and in all three way you have to provide TableName (of course)
	Now lets see those 3 :-
  1: Get By the Primary Key (partition or Sort) :-
			- Just provide the partition-key. This will gives you all the attributes stored against the key '10'. This is most efficient and fastest way.
					var params = { TableName: "MufUser",  Key:{ "userID": "10" } };	
					output: "Item": { "company": "Amdocs", "name": "Mufazzal", "salary": "200", "userID": "10"}	
			- This only work with PK not with other attribute So below params will give error in 'get' function
     			var params = { TableName: "MufUser",  Key:{ "name": "mufa" } };	  
     
     - This is most widely used way to get the data because it give whole data for that PK. 
		 - Data is always sorted by sort key if it is there.
     - But it has only one disadvantage. You have to provide the exack key. But lets say you wants to get the info about couple of key then its useless.
     
  2: Query:-
      Query is very useful when you are using the sort key with the partition key. Here once you get the data via your partion key, then you can apply some filter comparison over the sort key.
      For now lets say you hace the Partition-key as 'userID', Then the query will go-
      	var paramsQuery = { TableName: "MufUser", KeyConditionExpression: "userID = :a", ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":a": "34" } }     
        Out: [ { name: 'eee', genger: 'male', userID: '34' } ]         
			- A Query operation can retrieve a maximum of 1 MB of data. This limit applies before the filter expression is evaluated.
			- In the query function param you can use ONLY ONLY and ONLY 'equal' operatior for Partition-key. you cannot ever use any other operator with partition-key.
				So statement like KeyConditionExpression: "userID > :a" OR KeyConditionExpression: "userID IN :a" simply give an error if used with Query
			- You can use any operator with 'sort-key' though.
			- The 'query' function can only play with the sort-key-combination which lies in that partition-key
				EG:-
		    	KeyConditionExpression: "userID = :a", ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":a": "muffy" }
     				The above function will return r1, r2 and r3.
     			Now make a little change:-
	    		KeyConditionExpression: "userID = :a and OrderID = :b", ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":a": "muffy", ":b": "mob1" }
						This will give only r1
			- The KeyConditionExpression accept only the partition-key or sort-key. no one else so below will throw error
			- Result of Query will always be subset of single partition key. never has result ranging from two diffent partition key.
			- Supported operation for Sort Key	
					sortKeyName = :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is equal to :sortkeyval.
					sortKeyName < :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than :sortkeyval.
					sortKeyName <= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is less than or equal to :sortkeyval.
					sortKeyName > :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than :sortkeyval.
					sortKeyName >= :sortkeyval - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval.
					sortKeyName BETWEEN :sortkeyval1 AND :sortkeyval2 - true if the sort key value is greater than or equal to :sortkeyval1, and less than or equal to :sortkeyval2.
					begins_with ( sortKeyName, :sortkeyval ) - true if the sort key value begins with a particular operand. (You cannot use this function with a sort key that is of type Number.) Note that the function name begins_with is case-sensitive.
			- sort-key do not support 'IN()', =%***%, contains(*) etc.
				        
  3: Scan:
  	To read data this way is exterely resource sensitive. it should be used in very rare case. Unlike query it do not need any primary key to run. 
		it run over all the data items in the table. and provide the conditioned filtering on based of any kind of attribute.
		Though you can provide the 'FilterExpression' However, the filter is applied only after the entire table has been scanned.
		EG:-
			var paramsScan = { TableName: "UserOrder", FilterExpression: 'contains(device,:gen)', ExpressionAttributeValues: { ":gen": "e"}}
			docClient.scan(paramsScan, function(err, data) {console.log(err, data)});	
		This will produce all the data cell which has in its attribute 'device' a letter 'e'. the device is a simple attr not a key.
		Out:-
			[ {... device: 'samsung'},
				{... device: 'oneplus'},
				{... device: 'dell'}, ]
				
		Below will return the entire data in table
			var paramsScan = { TableName: "UserOrder", }	  
	  
	 - Wronglty written scan will produce large data which cant be shipped in an api response. for that the DDB 
		 automatically add the pagination feature in result. in the result if you get the 'LastEvaluatedKey' it means there is more data left
		 to read. 
	 
	--------------------
	
	Common between 'get', 'query' and 'Scan' both
		ProjectionExpression: 
			You can also tell in the query that only some specific attribute you wants to read via 'ProjectionExpression'
			eg: ProjectionExpression: 'name, company, cid'
		FilterExpression:-
			you can furthure filter the result based on the attribute also. for this you must use 'FilterExpression'
			- A filter expression cannot contain partition key or sort key attributes. 
			- for the the key. but 'FilterExpression' is optional. it just do tyhe after operation of furthur filtering
			-	A filter expression is applied after a Query finishes, but before the results are returned. 
					Therefore, a Query consumes the same amount of read capacity, regardless of whether a filter expression is present.

	--------------------
	 
	Add/Edit data item :-
	For this use 'put' function. 	See the example below
		var paramsPut = {TableName: "MufUser", Item: { userID: "20", name: 'abbas', city: "Pune" }}
		docClient.put(paramsPut, function(err, data) {console.log(err, data)});	
          
	- The main thing here is again param, you must must provide 'tableName' and 'Item' key 
	- In the 'Item' you have to neccesarily provide the partition-key. otherwise there will be an error.
	- In the 'Item' you have to neccesarily provide the Sort-key if it is set in the table. otherwise there will be an error.
	- You do not have to provide the keys in any special param, just it has to be in the 'Item' above 'userID' and 'OrderID'-
			are partition and Sort keys. fail to provide any single of them cause Error.
	 	
	Q: What will happen if the primary key (partition key OR partition key + Srt key) provided in 'put' is already exist
	A: It will be updated with new data.    
          
	Q: Can you insert a data cell in the DDB without Partition-key (along woth sort-key if applicable)?
	A: NO. you have to provide each one if table is design to have them. 
  	
	Quering the data via Attribute :- 
		Either by 'query' or 'get' function you can query the data by partition key OR partition key + Srt key
		but not with any other attributee.
		But if you still wants to make the query possible with any non-partition, non-sort attribute, you have to use 
		GSI (Global Secondry Index) or LSI(Local Secondry Index).
-------------
	
	BatchGetItem and BatchWriteItem::-
		You can use this apis for doing operation in batch.
		Max batch size for read = 100 and fro write = 25
	
-------------
	DDB transactoion:-
		Transcation is aset of query which should be all-or-nothing-run.
		This will run all the query or none at all.
		This is useful for operation like credit from A and debit to B.
--------------------

	TTL Attribute:-
		One of the issue with very large database is too keep deleting useless data. For this DDB provide a excellent feature.
		You ca set any particular attribute in the Table as 'TTL Attriute' 
		The data cell will automatically deleted after the time set in that attribute reached [It may take 48 hour to delete it]
		For this :-
			AWS > DDB > Table > 'your table' > Action > Manage TTL
			Set the attribute that you prefer should consist the value of TTL timestamp.
			lets say you set the attribute 'ExpirationTime'
			Done
		Now entry made by below 'put' request will be deleted after the time reached to '4234234344'	
			var paramsPutExpirationTime = {
			    TableName: "MufUser",
			    Item: {
				userID: "34",
				name: 'ttttt',
				city: "yyyyy",
				ExpirationTime: '4234234344'
			    }
			}			

-------

For AWS-JS-SDK :-
	any dynamoDB function can be conver in promise simply by calling the promise() function.
	the function
			docClient.get(params, function(err, data) {console.log(err, data)});
	is same as below
			docClient.get(params)
			.promise()
			.then(function(data, err) {console.log(err, data)});

----------
	DDB and Data Consistency:-
		The DDB have two type of data consistency and 
			1. Eventual Consistent Reads
					The atest PUT may not reflect in the READ. and you may get minute or two older data
			2. Strongly Consistent Reads
					All the latest PUT till the moment will be reflected, so data read will always be the latest till the point in time.
					
		it not set at time of creation of DB instead it is depend on how the request is made for read.
			If you want any read operation to be 'Strongly Consistent Reads' then pass the parameter 'ConsistentRead' in GetItem, Query, and Scan.
--------------------------

ReturnConsumedCapacity:-
	By default GetItem, Query and Scan none of them return the amount of read capacity they have consume in the operation.
	But in the request you can set paramter 'ReturnConsumedCapacity' get this info. It can have 3 values
	None: 		Default, return nothig.
	TOTAL: 		Return aggregate number of read capacity units consumed.
	INDEXED: 	Return aggregate number of read capacity units consumed + Consumed capacity for each table and index that was accessed

--------------------------

	DDB API:-
		Just like SDK where you call the function, there is also exposed API of DDB which you can call.

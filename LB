A lod balancer simply route the application request or network traffic to the diffrent targests like EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in multiple Availability Zones


<<<More theory needed>>>>

AWS provide three king of LB :-
  1. Application LB : for general purpos HTTP/HTTPS LB
  2. Network LB : for ultra efficient
  3. previous gener
  
  <<Detail diffrence come later>>


Creating A LB for EC2-webserver:-
  1. Take care that proper region is chossen.
  2. EC2 -> Load Balancer -> Create [Application LB] 
  3. Now slecet name 
  4. choose schema: internet facing
  5. Listener:-
      keep the HTTP port 80 open for allowing in the internet traffic
  6. Availability Zones :-
      Chose the Availability Zones [of region selected in step 1] where you wants to route the traffic. The LB will route the traffic to the targets, ( eg. EC2 )
      which lies in this zone only. 
  7. Security Group:
    A SCG which has inboud open as   HTTP   80   0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
  8. Routing Group: 
    Slect the routing group of you choice 
      8.1  select routing group name 'MufWebServerRoutingGroup'
      8.2  Target Type: instance.  Because we wants to rote to EC2 for now ???????????
      8.3  port and protocol ??????? [HTTP and 80 for now] 
      8.4 Health Chech ?????
      8.5 Register Target:
          8.5.1 Here you will register the targest for LB ports chosen in step 8.3
                This targets are instances of running EC2s, you can select multiple of them here.
  9 press Create and you are done   
 
 
 Now later if you wants to add or remove any Ec2 instance again then-
  EC2 ->  Load Balancing -> Target Group 
  Choose the one you created in step 9, and add remove target as in step 8.5.1

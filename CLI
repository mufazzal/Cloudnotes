  pwd:        Print current working directory
  ls:         list out all the file and folder
      -l      more detail
      -a      all file including hidden
      x/y/z   Items inside current_working_dir/x/y/z
  cd:         you know
      ~       go to home directory
      -       go to previous location
      
      
WHat id there is space in directory name?
A: USe quote->  cd "C:/user/Mufzzal Hussain"


Making directory:
  mkdir muf
MAking the herarchy too if not exist
  mkdir -P x/y/muf
  
  cp :>
  
  This is use for doing copy
  
  cp <file/foler to be copied> <destination file/folder>
  
  
cp folder folder ->  
  cp fo1 fo2              :   fo1 will copied in fo2, but not it content so C:/cwd/fo2/fo1 remian emprty
cp file folder ->
  cp fo1/fo11/f1.txt fo2  :   the file f1.txt will be copied in fo2 so C:/cwd/fo2/f1.txt [NOT C:/cwd/fo2/fo1/fo11/f1.txt]  
cp folder file ->
  Impossible

Copy recurssivly ->
cp -R folder folder ->  
  cp -R fo1 fo2              :   fo1 will copied in fo2 fully, and all content of fo1 will be in C:/cwd/fo2/fo1 also
cp -R file folder  
  MAke no sense. work same as in 'cp file folder'
  
  
  cp folder/ folder 
  cp fol1/ fol2  : this will copy the content not folder.
  
  

move: >
mv  <file/foler to be moved> <destination folder>

All rule remain same as cp. It never need -R because it move all thing entirly including content. and of course it delete the <file/foler to be moved> 
from system in the end



Removing: 

rm <empty directory>            : work
rm <file>                       : work
rm <non empty directory>        : error
rm -R <non empty directory>     : work and delete directory with all its content

 
Removing with force 
  use -f for this, It will forcefully remove the file. But you should have permission for this.
  rm -r -f <file or folder> 
  OR
  rm -rf <file or folder>

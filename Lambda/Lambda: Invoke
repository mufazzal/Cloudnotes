You can invoke the lambda function by 
  - Expicitly call Invoke Lambda API via any client
  - AWS SDK
  - AWS CLI
  - Trigger on other AWS services
  - Stream and SQS polling

Synchronus calling:-
  If you call the lambda invoke Synchronusly then it will first process the lambda and generate the response and producce result.
  By default AWS SDK, CLI and API call the lambda Synchronusly
  - When the function completes, Lambda returns the response from the function's code with additional data
  Eg: 
    aws lambda invoke --function-name my-function --payload '{ "key": "value" }' response.json


Asynchronus calling:-
  If you call the lambda invoke Asynchronusly then it will deliver the enevt and return immediatly. it do not wait for result to be produced.
  you don't wait for a response from the function code. You hand off the event to Lambda and Lambda handles the rest.
  - For asynchronous invocation, Lambda places the event in a queue and returns a success response without additional information.
  - In background, Lambda manages the function's asynchronous event queue and attempts to retry on errors
  - If the function can't keep up with incoming events, events might also be deleted from the queue without being sent to the function. So do handle it in code.
  - Below AWS service call the lambda Asynchronusly:-
      S3, SNS, SQS, Eventbridge.
  - Event 
  EG:  
    aws lambda invoke --function-name my-function  --invocation-type Event --payload '{ "key": "value" }' response.json

Function is a part which has the executable code.

Function can be define as:-
  - A source code 
  - A Container image file
  
Function as image file:-
  - For this you have to provide the Amazon ECR url.
  - You can also override beow configuration for image. Entrypoint, Command, Working directory
  - When you deploy code as a container image to a Lambda function, the image undergoes an optimization process for running on Lambda. 
    This process can take a few seconds, during which the function is in pending state. When the optimization process completes, the function enters the active state
  - You must ensure that the Role/User who create this lambda (not Execution Role) must have the permission 'GetRepositoryPolicy and SetRepositoryPolicy'


Enviorment Variable[EV]:-
  An environment variable is a pair of strings that are stored in a function's version-specific configuration.
  You can use environment variables to adjust your function's behavior without updating code. 
  - You define EV on the unpublished version of your function. When you publish a version, the EV are locked for that version  
  - Reserved environment variables: _HANDLER, AWS_REGION, _X_AMZN_TRACE_ID, AWS_EXECUTION_ENV  etc.
  - By default EV is encrypted at rest with AWS managed CMK.  You can use diffrent CMK also.
      For default CMK you do not need AWS KMS permission but for other CMK user/Execution role needs AWS KMS permission for that CMK.

  AWS Step Functions is an orchestration service that lets you connect Lambda functions together into serverless workflows.
  Use Step Functions to orchestrate serverless applications workflows. This orchestrate support human intervention as well.
  Step Functions maintains application state, tracking exactly which workflow step your application is in, and stores an event log of data that is passed between application components
  If in the flow any component faied then flow still can pick up from the point of failure.
  With step function you can:-
    Chaining          – Connect functions into a series of steps, with the output of one step providing the input to the next step.
    Catch and retry   – Handle errors using sophisticated catch-and-retry functionality.
    Branching         – Design your workflow to choose different branches based on Lambda function output.
    Parallelism       – Run functions in parallel, or use dynamic parallelism to invoke a function for every member of any array.
    Human intervention: 
    
  
  State Machine:-
    State machine is workflow made of steps. The workflow is written in 'Amazon States Language'
  
  Task:-
    Task is a single unit of work in machine.
    Out of all the types of State, only the Task State and the Parallel State can be used to run processes in the state machine
    
  Workflow type:-
    Tjhere is two kind of workflow
    1. Standard:- 
        - Can run up to an year
        - CAn run the flow at-most-once. never executed more then once unless it is specified.
        - Billed by number of transition made
        - best for processing payments.
        - Support 2000 Execution per sec, 4000 transition per sec 
        - Data of workflow is preserved for 90 day after its completion.
    2. Express:-  
        - Can run up to 5 minute
        - CAn run the flow at-least-once. So can run more then once.
        - Billed by Number of execution, duration of execution, memory consumed.
        - best for High volume event processing like IOT, Mobile Bakend, data transformation befire S3/DDB etc.
        - Support 100,000 Execution per sec, unlimited transition per sec 
        
        It can run in two way:-
          Asynchronous Express Workflows:-
            Here the requester do not waut for response. 
          Synchronous Express Workflows:-
            Here the requester do wait for response. 
            
    
State machine language:-
  this is made of the json syntaxes that create the flow. here you have type of step like
   Task     : Perform some task
   Choice   : like ig and else
   Fail     : make the workflow fail
   Succesd  : make the workflow fail
   Pass     : Simply pass its input to its output or inject some fixed data
   Wait     : Wait for specified time.
   Parallel : used to create parallel branches of execution in your state machine
    
    - Each state must have a Type field
    - Each state can have an optional Comment field to hold a human-readable comment about
    - Each state (except a Succeed or Fail state) requires a Next field
    - If Succeed or Fail state has 'End' field then it become the terminal state

  Task:
    This is piece of work to be done in state machine. It could be of three type
     1. Lambda:-
          Simplly provide the LAmbda ARN in Resource field. 
          EG:-
            "LambdaState": { "Type": "Task", "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:HelloWorld", "Next": "NextState" }        
     2. Activities:-
          Activity is the process or worker or thread that is hosted by you on EC2, ECS, on-premise.
          This worked implelement the proper interface with Steate machine via below function
            CreateActivity, GetActivityTask, ListActivities, SendTaskFailure, SendTaskHeartbeat, SendTaskSuccess
     3. AWS Service API:- 
          Give the ARN of the API in below formate in resource field
          arn:partition:states:region:account:servicename:APIname

      
  Transition: 
    every step do have a key Next which tell him about the next step.
    
  Machine Data:-
    This is Json formatted data which is pushed from the start when machine is started by 'StartExecution'.
    This data passed between states.
  
  Starting Execution:-
    It can e start by
    1. API StartExecution
    2. By Step function console
    3. By API Gateway
    4. By CW alarm 
    5. By another workflow.
    
  Error Handling:-
    For error handling in the Task and Paralle you can use either 'Retry' or 'Catch'
    Use retry for specific error and catch for unkown error.
    EG:-
      "HelloWorld": {
         "Type": "Task",
         "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:123456789012:function:FailFunction",
         "Retry": [ {
            "ErrorEquals": ["States.Timeout"],
            "IntervalSeconds": 1,
            "MaxAttempts": 2,
            "BackoffRate": 2.0
         } ],
        "Catch": [{ "Next": "..." }]
        "End": true
      }    
    So here if erro is of type Timeout then it make a retry otherwise go to catch abd to next seop mentioned.   
  
-----------
Best Practice:-
  1. Use timeouts to avoid stuck executions
  2. Use Amazon S3 ARNs instead of passing large payloads 
  3. Avoid latency when polling for activity tasks

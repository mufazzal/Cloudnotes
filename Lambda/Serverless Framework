Layer:-
  with the SF you can deploy the layer and also can attach it to lambda function.
  
  How to create layer:-
    create such strucure
      
      serverless.yml
      commonlibs
            |---nodejs
                  |-----package.json
                  |-----node_modules
                            |--------aws-sdk
                            |--------moment
                            |--------axious  
       
      The content of serverless.yml:-
            service: UAP-libs
            provider:
              name: aws
              stage: beta
              region: us-east-1  
              runtime: nodejs12.x

            layers:
              commonLibs:
                path: 'commonlibs'      
                
      Now run the command 'sls deploy' at directory in which the 'serverless.yml' lies.
      in the outpu you will get the arn of the created layer.
      
      
     How to attach:-
     for attaching it simply provide the list of arn you wants to attach. 
     also optional but strongly recommended : exclude the module from uploading which are already in the layer.
     
        ....
        ....
        functions:
          getUsers:
            handler: handler.getUsers
            layers: 
             - arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:388412347424:layer:CommonNodeJsLibs:2
            events:
                ...
        package:
          exclude:
            - node_modules/**     
      
      node_modules/** :- will exclude all the node modules
      to exclude some specific who are in layer use
        
        node_modules/moment/**
        node_modules/logger/**

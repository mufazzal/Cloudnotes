CW Metrics:-
  Namespace:- 
    'AWS/Lambda'
  Metrics:-
    Invocation metrics: Invocations, Errors[Function error not Invocation error], Throttles 
    Performance metrics: Duration 
    Concurrency metrics: ConcurrentExecutions, ProvisionedConcurrentExecutions, 
  Dimensions:-
    Function Name, Resource [specific function version], Across All Functions 
    
Function Insight:-
  If you wnats to have information regarding runtime metrices of the function then enable this.
  Lambda Insights uses a CloudWatch-Lambda-Insights-extension, which is provided as a Lambda layer. When you enable this extension on a Lambda, 
  it collects system-level metrics and emits a single performance log event for every invocation of that Lambda function
    CPU time, memory, disk and network usage, Cold start 
  - If you enable this then it will cost you.

Function Log:-
  You can insert logging statements into your code to help you validate that your code is working as expected. 
  Lambda automatically integrates with CloudWatch Logs and pushes all logs from your code to a CloudWatch Logs group associated with a Lambda function, 
  which is named /aws/lambda/<function name>.
  

AWS X-Ray:-
  Lambda is nicely integrated with AWS X-Ray. 
  You can use X-Ray SDK in the code of lambda and add annotation etc than can be viewd in X-Ray dasboard.

Lambda is the smallest unit of code that can run as serverless on AWS system.

Lambda and IAM Role:-
  You have to assign a Role to ypur lembda function. and tahe role must have a permission 'AWSLembdaExecute'.
  Along with this yous should also assign the permission if you wants to access/change/operate any other AWS service
  So create the Role you wants first
  
Creating the Lembda:-
  1.  Compute > Lembda > Create Lembda
  2.  input the name and desc
  3.  Choose Role you created earlier
  4.  Chosse runtime like Node, Java etc.
  5.  either write code or upload the ZIP
    5.1 if file is ZIP then you must specify 'Handler' as <fileName>.<functionName>, which will be placed at root of ziped folder
  6 Also set the env variable if required {eg. if runtime is Node then you can use process.env.<envVarName> in the code and set its value in AWS console}
  Now you are done with the code But when this little pice of code will ran ?
  Next! Lets set the trigger for this Lambda
  7. AWS COnsole > Lambda > Functions > select your lambda function > configuration > Add Trigger
  8 Now here the configuration of trigger is done. This is very abstract topic and you can set up diffrent AWS service to trigger this 
    function for you
    E.G : you can Select S3, then select the bucket in it and set the event like upload, delete, edit file to trigger this event
  Done
  
 Setting up envirment vasrible:-
  You can use the env variable in the code and supply its value via aws console.
  EG: in node runtime-
    ...
    if(process.env.isprod === tru)
      ...
    now set the value of 'isprod' in aws console simply.

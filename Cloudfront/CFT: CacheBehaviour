The CAche behavoiur define how CFT will manage the cache of diffrent origin.
The request on CFT always comes first on CacheBehaviour. Here it cgheck if response is there in cache for that response 
if yes then with the value of PathPattern it decide to which origin the request will be sent to.

This control many things about the cache and origin. all setting of cache behavoiur is applied on the cache and origin of matched PathPattern:-
  AllowedMethods:- 
    This decide which HTTP methods will be allowed to be forwarded from CFT -> Origin.
    There is only three option
      - forwards only GET and HEAD requests.
      - forwards only GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.
      - forwards GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE requests
  CachedMethods:-
    This decide response of which HTTP methods will be cached in the CFT. There is two option here
      - forwards only GET and HEAD requests.
      - forwards only GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS requests.    
    IMP: CFT can never cache the PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE requests. because it make no sense at all.
    
  LambdaFunctionAssociations:-
    The CFT can call the lambda function at specific event fo better handling. you can fire the lambda at 4 specific events
    1. Viewer Request               
    2. Origin Request
    3. Origin Response
    4. Viewer Response
        V---1-->C---2-->O
        V<--4--C<---3---O
    It not necessary that each lambda call for each requets.
    EG: if request is honored for cache

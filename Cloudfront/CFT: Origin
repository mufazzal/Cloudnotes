In the distribution there can be more then one Origin. The requets first analyze by CacheBehaviour and then based on CacheBehaviour[i].Pathpattern the correct origin will be 
used to get the uncahed data object.
This is mostly provide mechanics how the CFT will connect the the Origin.
  
  ConnectionAttempts and ConnectionTimeout: As name suggeest they define how many time and ho long CFT will attaempt to connect to Origin before considering faillure.
  CustomOriginConfig:-
    Use this for custom origin and static S3 website. THis contains info about how the CFT will connect to Origin.
    You need to set here belo main items
      "HTTPPort" : Integer,
      "OriginKeepaliveTimeout" : Integer,
      "OriginProtocolPolicy" : http-only | https-only | match-viewer,
    OriginProtocolPolicy: This define by what protocol CFT will connect to Origin. match-viewer means that CFT will use same protocol as of Viwer-->CFT.
    
    OriginProtocolPolicy VS ViwerProtocolPolicy: 
      ViwerProtocolPolicy is for Viewer--->CFT and define at CacheBehaviour[i]
      OriginProtocolPolicy is for CFT----->Origin and define at Origins[i].CustomOriginConfig.
      
   DomainName: 
    Domain name of Origin 
   Origin Path: 
    The subdirectory of origin for root of requests.
    EG:-
      CFTDomain: mufcft.cloudfront.com
      Origin Domain Name – An Amazon S3 bucket named myawsbucket  
      Origin Path – /production
    When a user enters 
    mufcft.cloudfront.com/acme/index.html in a browser, CloudFront sends a request to Amazon S3 for 
    <originDomainame:port>/production/acme/index.html      

    The formate of Domain name also define thetype of origin. CFT support below origin and those origin has specific DNM name formate
      Amazon S3 bucket configured as a website – awsexamplebucket.s3-website.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
      Amazon S3 bucket not configured as a website – awsexamplebucket.s3.amazonaws.com
      MediaStore container – examplemediastore.data.mediastore.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
      MediaPackage endpoint – examplemediapackage.mediapackage.us-west-1.amazonaws.com
      Amazon EC2 instance – ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com
      Elastic Load Balancing load balancer – example-load-balancer-1234567890.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com
      Your own web server – https://example.com
 

  Id:
    A unique identifier for the origin. This value must be unique within the distribution.
    Use this value to specify the TargetOriginId in a CacheBehavior or DefaultCacheBehavior
  
  OriginCustomHeaders: IF you wants to add the additional header for request from CFT to Origin.
    You have to specify the name and value of header here. This is specific to parent Origin only not for al the origin in distribution.

Origin Group:-
  This is very useful in case of failover at Origin. 
  1. Here you first have to create a Origin and add two origin in it.
      A Primary Origin
      A Secondry Origin
  2. Set the HTTP code of primary origin which is cosidedred as failure like 5XX and 4XX
  3. Now finally, in the Cache behavour instead of gicinf an Origin id gived the Origin Group Id.
  Done
  Now CFT will first send the request to primary origin and if it fail the CFT will redirect same request to Secondry origin.
  So this give you better availibilty in case of failover at primary.
  
  VIMP: 
    Only failoveer with HTTP Codes mentioned in step 2 will be consider for handling not other.
    Only GET, HEAD and OPTION request are handled not other like PUT, POST

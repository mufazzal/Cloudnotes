In CFT you have 3 option of Secrity

  1. Encryption in Transit
    - For this simply make CacheBehaviour[*].ViwerProtocolPolicy and Origin[*].OriginProtocolPolicy as HTTPS.
  2. Encryption at Rest
    - AWS uses SSD drives at Edge location and have the Encryption always enabled. so no worry for this.

  3. Restrict Access to Content
    - Use signed URLs or cookies
    - Use OAI for S3
    - Restrict access to content served by an Application Load Balancer with CustomHeader
    - Use AWS WAF
    - Use Geo Restriction

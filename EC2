What is rackspace


Why EC2: because purchasing a server and maintaining them is a hell.
          Now with EC2 you buy a machine and ready to go.
          
          

Pricing-
  On Demand:
    You pay by usage/hour or per second
    Best For -
      If you do not need any long term contract
      Low Cost
      Short live application
  Reserved:
    You reserve the capasity for a certain time (for a 1 yera to 100s of year).
    You are locked in a contract. AWS generally provide yuo discount if you contract for longer time. You also need to pay some amount upfront.
    Best For -
      App that need steady and predictable usages (So you calculate the computing power well in advance, 
                                                        so pay upfront in advance and get good discount from AWS)
      Type of Reserved :-
        1. Standard:    You cant change the EC2 instance type
        2. Convertible: You can change the EC2 instance type      
        2. Schedule
  Spot:
      This work like a biding in stock market, you bid for a any instacne with many others. 
      The best one get the deal, and if sombody again ready to pay more then you lose (after some agreed time) this instance.
      Best For:-
         Me: Hey! i want to do this task its kind of R and D, but it will take fair computing power so buy some Ec2. no specific strat or end time required
         Finance: We do not have much money for R and D. 
         Me: Ok! lets go to Spot pricing, when it cost low buy some, work on it, release if it get costly, and  keep doing it at very low cost.
         Finance: smart guy.
  Dedicated Host:
    Generally if you need to follow soome regulatory protocols.
    
    
Type of Ec2 instances-
  There are couple of EC2 instances which are design to achive a specific goal
  EG
    T3    Low Cost-Genral purpose     web server/small DB
    G3    Graphics intensive          video
    I3    High speed storage          NoSql, DBs
    R5    Memory optimized            Memory intensive
    M5    General Purpose             App Server
    ...
    ...
    
Subtype of instances:-
   Each above type of instance is design to support and handle specific type of requirment. Like one is best for
   DB and other is optimized for game. 
   After selecting a type nest thing is how intensive you wants to use your system.
   EG: you say i need a DB optimized Or web-server optimized instance, But how intensive your workload going to be.
   Depending on this you select the subcategory.
   
   Lets say i wants a general purpose T3 instance.
   Now    if my workload is moderate then i will go for t3.small
          if my workload is significant then i will go for t3.large
          if my workload is bulky then i will go for t3.xlarge
   Whats diffrence in between this instances :-
          diffrence comes in Memory-size (RAM not EBS), vCPU count, Storage type (EBS or other).
      
  
  >> Type and SubType is two most fundamental decesion you must take before selecting an instance.
  
  Setting instance configuration:-
   Once you decided waht type and subtype you wants, next comes the configuration
   This are the peramter you set before launcing, Some example are
   1. No of instances
   2. Autoscalling
   3. spot price config if needed
   4. network and VPC ???
   5. subnet: decide in which AZ the instance will lie
   6. assign public IP: aws has a pool of public IP avialable to use. If you need one then it will be assign to your EC2.
                        With Public IP you can access the Ec2 instance over public internet
   7. Capacity reservation if needed
   .....etc.
   


The next IMP thing comes in EC2 is Hard Disk Drive, You need to devide how much storage you need for any EC2 instance
The storage in EC2 is EBS    
    EBS:-
    As like any normal PC/Server the virtual PC/Server also need a hard disk, EBS play this role
    EBS is virtual Hard Disk Drive of you EC2 instance.
    You can use this drive to 
      install OS, mounting File System, DB etc.
    Type of EBS :-
      1. SSD
          1.1 GP2 : General Purpos SSD- 
              balanced price, good performance
              Best for : general purpose
          1.2 IO1 : Provisioned IOPS SSD - 
              Highest performance, High price
              Best for: mission-critical, low latancy and high throuput work. best for main DB's of your app
       2. Megnetic
          2.1  ST1 :  Throughput optimize 
                 Low cost - frequently accessed
         2.2   SC1 :  Cold HDD  
                Lowest cost - less frequently accessed 
                Best for file server.
            
    
Depending on your requirment you select the storage type, But as like computing power here also you need to decide on
capasity of your storage.
Seting the congiguration for EBS:-
    When you set up the EC2 and EBS for that EC2. First decide how many drive you need. (at least one is must)
    The first drive is always the default one and called Root. You can chnage its type, size but cant delete it.
    Its root path is also fixed (eg. : '/dev/xvda' for linux).
    Only GP2 and IO1 can be used as Root
You can create more than one drive, the non-root drive can be one of type GP2, IO1, SC1, ST1. you can chose its size, drive-path
Also you should note down the IOPS(input output per second) of selected device for performance tuning.
          
     So Following thing you Set for EBS -
          1. Type
          2. device path
          3. snapshot ?????
          4. Size
          5. Note down IOPS
          6. Delete on termination ????
          7. Encryption

Geography of EBS and EC2 :- A EBS attached to EC2 does lie in the same AZ as of EC2.
    

Security Of EC2 instance:-
    This is most critical part of EC2, Security of EC2 is implemented via Security group attached to EC2 
    Security group is nothing but a kind of firewall around EC2, that decide who can communicate to EC2 and who cannnot.
    
    ## Read Network Traffic Protocol ### in notes.txt
    
    Over the network there is multiple way to connect the EC2 with external system
    1. If EC2 is linux based instance then we can use SSH (at port 22 of EC2)
    2. If EC2 is window based instance then we can use RDP (at port 22 of 3892)
    3. Connect EC2 (any based) with internet traffic with HTTP and HTTPS ( on port 80 or 443)
    4. POP, SMTP ....etc.

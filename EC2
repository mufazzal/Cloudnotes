What is rackspace


Why EC2: because purchasing a server and maintaining them is a hell.
          Now with EC2 you buy a machine and ready to go.
          
          

Pricing-
  On Demand:
    You pay by usage/hour or per second
    Best For -
      If you do not need any long term contract
      Low Cost
      Short live application
  Reserved:
    You reserve the capasity for a certain time (for a 1 yera to 100s of year).
    You are locked in a contract. AWS generally provide yuo discount if you contract for longer time. You also need to pay some amount upfront.
    Best For -
      App that need steady and predictable usages (So you calculate the computing power well in advance, 
                                                        so pay upfront in advance and get good discount from AWS)
      Type of Reserved :-
        1. Standard:    You cant change the EC2 instance type
        2. Convertible: You can change the EC2 instance type      
        2. Schedule
  Spot:
      This work like a biding in stock market, you bid for a any instacne with many others. 
      The best one get the deal, and if sombody again ready to pay more then you lose (after some agreed time) this instance.
      Best For:-
         Me: Hey! i want to do this task its kind of R and D, but it will take fair computing power so buy some Ec2. no specific strat or end time required
         Finance: We do not have much money for R and D. 
         Me: Ok! lets go to Spot pricing, when it cost low buy some, work on it, release if it get costly, and  keep doing it at very low cost.
         Finance: smart guy.
  Dedicated Host:
    Generally if you need to follow soome regulatory protocols.
    
    
Type of Ec2 instances-
  There are couple of EC2 instances which are design to achive a specific goal
  EG
    T3    Low Cost-Genral purpose     web server/small DB
    G3    Graphics intensive          video
    I3    High speed storage          NoSql, DBs
    R5    Memory optimized            Memory intensive
    M5    General Purpose             App Server
    ...
    ...
    
Subtype of instances:-
   Each above type of instance is design to support and handle specific type of requirment. Like one is best for
   DB and other is optimized for game. 
   After selecting a type nest thing is how intensive you wants to use your system.
   EG: you say i need a DB optimized Or web-server optimized instance, But how intensive your workload going to be.
   Depending on this you select the subcategory.
   
   Lets say i wants a general purpose T3 instance.
   Now    if my workload is moderate then i will go for t3.small
          if my workload is significant then i will go for t3.large
          if my workload is bulky then i will go for t3.xlarge
   Whats diffrence in between this instances :-
          diffrence comes in Memory-size (RAM not EBS), vCPU count, Storage type (EBS or other).
      
  
  >> Type and SubType is two most fundamental decesion you must take before selecting an instance.
  
  Setting instance configuration:-
   
    
    
    EBS:-
    As like any normal PC/Server the virtual PC/Server also need a hard disk, EBS play this role
    EBS is virtual Hard Disk Drive of you EC2 instance.
    You can use this drive to 
      install OS, mounting File System, DB etc.
    Type of EBS :-
      1. SSD
          1.1 GP2 : General Purpos SSD- 
              balanced price, good performance
              Best for : general purpose
          1.2 IO1 : Provisioned IOPS SSD - 
              Highest performance, High price
              Best for: mission-critical, low latancy and high throuput work. best for main DB's of your app
       2. Megnetic
          2.1  ST1 :  Throughput optimize 
                 Low cost - frequently accessed
         2.2   SC1 :  Cold HDD  
                Lowest cost - less frequently accessed 
                Best for file server.
            
    
    
    
    
    Geography of EBS and EC2 :- A EBS attached to EC2 does lie in the same AZ as of EC2.

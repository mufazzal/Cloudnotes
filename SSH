Shell, cms, cli hell lot of term. lets dive.

What is Shell -
This is the program that facilitate the interaction of user with OS via commands.
Everything you do with GUI (e.g copy, search, paste, zip, play, stop), you can do it with Shell commands.

Type of Shell ->
There are many shell avaialable today for veraity of feature and for veriety of OS.
Most used are -
  bash:       globally pre-installed in Linux and MAC
  window CMD: globally pre-installed in Window
  sh:         legacy luinux
  
When you open terminal in ubuntu or cmd in window, corrosponding Shell activated automatically.

Connecting Remote Linux Machine (or linux server) with shell :-
There is many way to do it. like telnet, ftp etc.
The most famous and recomended one is SSH. telnet is so unsafe that it carry password as plain text over unsecure network
Why? becoz of its safty

--------> SSH  <-------------

What is SSH:
SSH is a way to connect a linux machine with any remote shell. 
This provide you a secure way to communicate with linux sever over the unsecure network.
IMP: SSH provide you the way to connect the linux machine by any client-shell. 
Now its depend on the shell what kind of operation it can perform.

Shell VS SSH :-
Shell - A large set of commands(copy, cut, ls, cat) that perform operation on Linux
SSH - A specific set of command that help you to connect to remote linux machine.

Note ->
To connect a Remote linux machine you must have below things
  1.  address of that machine (IP or DNS name).
  2.  At least one user-account of that machine. 
  3.  SSH communicate using TCP, and by default SSH listen over port 22. so port 22 must be open (if not customized for other port)
  4.  Most IMP: a  key value pair.
  
First three things are technical detail you must knew but key value pair is you also can generate and set-up.

Ways connect with SSH ->
There is 2 way
  1. With password  [rarely and unsafe]
  2. With key pair   [widely and safe]

How to generate public-private key value pair using SSH:-
  open cmd/terminal/poweshell and use command
    ssh-keygen -C myofficekey -f C:\Mufazzal\cloud\keys\myofficekey
               <-----A------> <-------------B--------------------->
    A: This is the commnet, it will be appended in the end of public key to make it recognizable, optinal
    B: The path/filename: 2 file (one public, one private) wil be generated at this location


The Mechanics of connection establishment with key pair :-
Lets say 3 client (muf, fat arw) wants to connect a remote linux machine (bar), and bar have user 'sha'/'ras'
prerequisite : get the address and user of remote linux machine and A client machine (window/linux/mac) but must have SSH installed in it
Setting up key pair: 
  1. Each one will generate their key pair with SSH (ssh-keygen command)
  2. Each one will store their privaate key in safe location of his/her local client machine
  3. Each one will MANUALLY send the their public key to bar
  4. Now bar will also store all the public key at some safe place.
  So finally muf, mur and arw has their private key with then and there public key shared to bar
  
  muf[pk1]   
  fat[pk2]    -------------   bar [pbk1, pbk2, pbk3] {sha, ras}      
  arw[pk3]
  
 Finally Requesting 'bar' for connection:
  lets say 'muf' wants to login on 'bar' with user 'sha'
  for this 'muf' will use this command
      
      ssh <remoteServerUser>@<remoteServerAddress> -p <remotServerListingPort> -i <localPrivateKeyFile>
      ssh       sha         @     bar.com          -p         22               -i  C:/....
      <-><------A----------><-------B------------><-----------C----------------><---------D----------->
     
      A: the remote user [Must]
      B: adress, either IP or DNS [must]
      C: Port: [optinal] default 22
      D: private key file of 'muf': [optianl] default location is 'C:/user/muf/.ssh/id_rsa'
  How this connection handshakw happen ->
  in very high level just remember
    client send ID of its key pair (not private key)
    server now goes in its trust store and look for matching public key
    if he fouds then server acknowladge it
    and finaly a connection establish.
  
 A grant rule:- 
 In any Asymetric cryptography, Public key will encrypt the data and only its private couterpart will decrypt it. 
 
  
  
After connection establishment how comm will occure:-
  suppose 'muf' has established the connection with 'bar', and their server(bar) ready with public key and client(bar) with private
  lets say 'muf' ran a command '-ls' in CLI
  This command will go to remote linux 'bar'
  He will execute it and generate result as list of directory ['home', 'image', 'data']
  Now server(bar) will be encrypt this result with corresponding public key 
      so  ['home', 'image', 'data'] + "...public key of muf...."  -> [......encrypted.......]
  Now it will be sent to 'muf'
  Now client 'muf' will decrypt it with its private key
       [......encrypted.......] + Private key --> ['home', 'image', 'data']
     
            
Q: Where the client keep the private key file
A: Whereever you wants, jmust pass the correct path in ssh command

Q: Where the remote linux server keep all the public keys
A  by default in './ssh/authorized_keys' file by default. you can also change it.




SSH and linux-
  SSH is globally preinstalled in any linux machine so you never need ti install it. its implemented usin OpenSSH library 
SSH and window-
  SSH in preinstalled in window 10+ so no need to install. it is also implemented usin OpenSSH library. 
  For older window you can use Putty Client 
  
SSH vs openSSH -
  SSH is the protocol.
  OpenSSH is an implementation client & server of that protocol.


?????
check port 22 after and before conn
authorized_keys 
known_host
find where is authorized_keys in server

ssh ec2-user@54.237.220.77 -i /home/mufazzal/.ssh/id_rsa

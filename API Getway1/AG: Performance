API Caching:-
  You can set to cache the api response for quick response.
  Caching enable AG to answer the request from cache rather reaching to integration point all the time.
  This is enabled for stage level but can ne overried for Specific HTTP Methode. This is applicable for all the resouce coming in the API.
  - You also have to set the TTL and maximun storage capacity.
  - You can also turn on or off the encryption. though encryption will add a latency and increase storage.
  - By default only GET methode is cached if caching is enabled. but you can change this behaviour bu override for Methode.
  - for monitoring you can Inspect the CloudWatch metrics of CacheHitCount and CacheMissCount for your API and stage
  - For cache key you can use all or some of below items in diffrent combination
      - Query param
      - Headers
      - Url Path
  Flush cache: you can clear all the cache for a given stage.
    you can do it at the stage level.
  Invalidate Cache via clent:
    client of your API can invalidate an existing cache entry and reload it from the integration endpoint for individual requests.
    The client must send a request that contains the Cache-Control: max-age=0 header. The client receives the response directly from the integration endpoint instead of the cache
  
  
Risk with Cache-Control: max-age=0
  If you expose the API and say many of the user simply set this header in order to get the latest data.
  This can cause the significant increase in latency and call on integration endpoint.
  To resolve this You should simply check 'Requird Authorization' in AG > yout apis > Stag > your stage > caching > in section 'per-key cache invalidation' > true
  Now the authorized IAM user can do the invalidation but for anuthirized you can take one of three action
  1. Fail with 403
  2. Ignore 'Cache-Control' header and add warnig
  3. Ignore 'Cache-Control'

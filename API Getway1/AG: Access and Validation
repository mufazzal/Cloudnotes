Validation:-
	You can set it at Method Request. 
	You can make certain params necessary for client to send and Verify (not authenticate) if API is in correct form:-
	Verify if API caller has provided proper structure like body, header, query param
      This will check if the caller has proper params in the API. it does not verify if he has the access to that api or not.
      How:-
        at your  Api > Method Request 
          set 'URL Query String Parameters', 'HTTP Request Headers', 'Request Body'
      This is very basic level of check.
		How:-
			go to AWS > API GEtway > API collection > api > methode > MEthode Request
			Now set the 'Request Validator' as such that what parts in api you wants to check
			Now you can configure belo three things
				Query String ->  www.*******.com?uName=Muf                    Here you setup qery in api must look like  
				Header       ->  www.*******.com {Header:{ uname: "Muf"}}     Here you setup headers must look like  
				Query String ->  www.*******.com?{body:{ uname: "Muf"}}       Here you setup body model must look like  
			This authoization can work only upto request formate level.
			It n verify if required data prsent in the call or not. But there is no way that it can verify that whoever
			is accessing this api have permission/authority to go into it.
      
---------------------      

Access:-
	Resource policies:-
		You can set the resource policy at API collection and set the it to access or denied 
			- Users from a specified AWS account.
			- Specified source IP address ranges or CIDR blocks.
			- Specified virtual private clouds (VPCs) or VPC endpoints (in any account).
			You must provide them access to the 'arn:aws:execute-api' action.
	IAM Policy:-
		Its is used to grant or deny below access to IAM users
		- To create, deploy, and manage an API in API Gateway
		- Controlling who can create and manage your APIs, as well as who can invoke them.

API Getway and CORS:-
  By default all the api in the API getway has the cors disabled. It can be enecbled easily by 
    AWS > API Getway > you api > resources > Select Action in DD > Enable CORS.
    
  API Getway and CORS and Lambda:-
    If lambda is integrated as the response generator in the APPI then above step is not enough for cors. 
    for this you havr to take care of additional headers in the reponse of lambda.
    
    So the response of lambda should have this header:-
      
 	  res = { 
          statusCode: ****, 
          body: *******,
          headers: {'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*'}
		}
		return res;

The monitering prefrences are set the the satge and API level [not at resource level]
  For setting the monitoring you can
  
  1. Enable CloudWatch Metrics:
      This gave you detailed information as mentioed below at API level. 
      Domain: 'AWS/ApiGateway'
      Metrics: 4XXError, 5XXError, CacheMissCount, CacheHitCount, Count, IntegrationLatency, Latency
      Dimention: ApiName, 'ApiName, Method, Resource, Stage'
  3. Enable CloudWatch Log:-
      If enabled, then Itâ€™s fully managed by API Gateway
      - API Gateway automatically creates a CloudWatch log group with the name API-Gateway-Execution-Logs_{rest-api-id}/{stage_name}.
      - You can only choose the log level (INFO or ERROR) and whether or not to log the full API request/response data.
      - This gave you very good insight for a flow of specific request to and from client and back-end with full request response data at each juncture.
      - This include
        > The request URL
        > The request data  received    by    API Gateway           from      Client
        > The request data  sent        to    Integrated Backend    from      API Gateway 
        > The response      received    by    API Gateway           from      Integrated Backend 
        > The response data sent        to    Client                from      API Gateway
        > The details on the usage plan, API key used to process the request, etc
      - Be careful to use it. though it charge at standard rate of CW logs. but if your APIS are too much in use then it can shoot up your CW bill. 
  4. Access Log:-
      Access logs are logs of who has accessed.
      - It can be deliver to CW logs group or kenesis stream [you have to create it]
      - This is very useful for analytics work.
      - You can customize the log formate. 
      - This Include:-
        > The client's IP address
        > The request time
        > The request HTTP method
        > The request URL
        > The response HTTP status code, etc.
     
  4. Enable X-Ray Tracing
      You can use AWS X-Ray to trace and analyze user requests as they travel through your Amazon API Gateway REST APIs to the underlying services
      
  5. Cloudtrail:-
      With this you can track who make changes in the API. like creating new API, Resource, Methode etc. or delete any of that.
      It do not track the API call by clients

API Gateway Endpoint [Reaching ti API]:-
	When you create API [Not API resource] you can how user can reach to those APIs
	There is 3 way
		1. Regional
		2. Edge Optimized
		3. Private
		
		Regional:-
			Here the API are deployed to specific AWS region. Though user can access those apis from any where in worls but its faster for the user of the region  where this API lies.
			This is useful if you user are clustred in specifiv region.
		Edge Optimized:-
			Here AG utilize the Edge location for fast respionse to anywhere in the world. This is useful if you user are spread globally.
		Private:-
			This useful if you wants the APIS to be callable from your VPC only. It cannot be called form outside of VPC by public internet.
							
			
API Gateway Integration [forwarding request]:-
	This is applicable at resource level of API. 
	You can configure how a request will be handle for any resource of any methode type.
	You forward the request to
		Lambda
		HTTP
		AWS service 
		Private link
	Most of those forward are easy to understand but one of them is tricky that is 'Private link'
	
	
	Private link [Forwarding to Private VPC component]:-
		Suppose if you wants to forward the request to any VPC component then again you need a proper set up
		[Do No Confuse]: Private Endpoint means APi can be called from inside the VPC only. and Private Link is for forwarding the request to internal VPC component.
			Private Endpoint:  VPC to AG without internet via VPC-EP
			Private Link:			 form internet to AG and then AG to VPC via NLB of VPC  
			How:-
				At VPC side:-
					If this VPC need to handle the integration with AG then it must must must have a working Network Load Balancer in it.
					So set up the NLB here.
				At AG:-
					1. Create the VPC link 
							Go to AG > VPC link
							Select the NLB created at VPC side
					2. Integrate VPC Link to apis:- 
							Go to AG > your apis > 'select resource' > integration
							select integration = 'VPC Link'
							slect the VPC link you created in step 1
							Also fill the Endpont value with DNS of NLB created at VPC side.
					Done.
				Now the request coming to AG [from anywhere] will be forwared to NLB of VPC.

AG and Stage:-
	At stage level you can set below items for APIs [not api resource]
		- Caching
		- Default Method Throttling
		- WAF
		- Client Certificate
		- Stage Variable
		- Monitering mechanics

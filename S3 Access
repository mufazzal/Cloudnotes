S3 security -	
    S3 provide you the two type of security for ant bucket/file	
    1. Encryption	
    2. Access level	



 Access Managment S3 :-	
 For Access managemet there is three level where the owner can decide the access of any S3 item	
  1. Bucket Policy: Ay Bucket level	
  2. Access Control List: at file/object level.	
    2.1. Public Accesibility of file.	
  3. IAM Policy

  Bucket Policy : -	
    BP is the way to define the accessibility of the bucket. The BP applied to all the object in the bucket.	
    Bucket policy can grant the access of bucket for certaion operation to other user, other account, user group.	
    BP attached to bucket and apply to all objevt inside.	
    BP cannot be attached to object inside.	
    This is simplay a json doc.	


 Access Control List :- 	
    The BP is applied over the Bucket, that give you quite higher level of access management	
    The ACL is applied over the object and bucket both. It define what user, user group, etc can have access to 	
    the underline object or buccket 	
    It gives you very fine grain way to manage access of any objct in S3 as well.	

IAM Policy :-
    ??????????????????????

 2.1  	
 Anonymus Public Accesibility [Special cass of ACL] :-    	
   The APA provide tou a extremly simpole way to make any file/object public, without digging into ACL.	
   It automatically manage/create/edit the attached ACL to make the file/objct anonymously accessible with #URL_2.	
   The first two kind of Access management (ACL and BP) tells you that if user/user group/account/role etc can do certaion operration	
   on the underline resource or not	
   APA will set up the ACL properly to make the file be accessible ANONYMOuSLY or not. mns will this file be accessible with #URL_2 or not.	
   VVIMP: You must stuck in your mind that 'Anonymus Public Accesibility' only and only deal with url '#URL_2'	



Block Public Access feature [BPAF]:-        	
  Above all 3 there is one more option lies, and this can (or cannot) override all the permission granted through either of above three	
  this is 'Block Public Access feature'.	
  This has power to deny the access granted through above 3, but do not have any way to grant acceess which is deny by above 3	
  This has a 4 option that you can select at a time of either bucket creation or from   	
        AWS > S3 > your bucket > Permisssion >  Block Public Access >  4 checkboxes. 	

  If you have checked all 4:-	
    It means you have blocked all the access to the public. this will completely override all the accesses granted throug 	
    either BP, ACL, APA. All the access are denied. ?????????????i doubt?????????	

 if all 4 are unchecked :-	
    In this case this permission filter is completely shut off. it wont deny any kind of access. So all the permission granted through	
    either BP, ACL, APA will be honoured. ?????????????i doubt?????????	

  Default value :-	
    By default the all 4 remain checked, so the bucket by default deny any kinfd on bublic access.    	

   How to set it:-	
    1.  For new bucket creation: U will see this 4 option in process of bucket creation flow	
    2.  For existing one: AWS > S3 > 'your bucket' > Permission > Block public access	
         Set the checkboxes.


 

------------------------------------------


ACL over Bucket :-

 prerequisite - 
    To make the ACL working for the bucket the first thing you have to do is to configure BPAF properly 
    for this you must UN-CHECK below two check boxes
      1. Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new access control lists (ACLs)
      2. Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
    If this two is checked then your ACL policy will all be useless, The BPAF will deny all the access granted via ACL of this bucket
    
MAnaging Anonymus/Public Access via ACL of bucket :-
   When i say anonymus/public access, it means that accessing the content of bucket via #URL_2, without any login, authentication or authorization
   The type anonymus access you can give are 
    1.  List Object : getting the list of object in bucket, EG api A1,   
    2.  Write Object: Adding an item in the bucket, Eg api A2
  In simple world if
  ACL provide public permission = 'List Object', then A1 will work
  ACL provide public permission = 'List Object' and 'Write Object' , then api A1, A2 both will work
  Does write provide access to delete the object from content 
  No! dont know why. It provide way to add the object, change it also but not delete it.
  
  How to give this permission :-

  For existing one:-
     1. AWS > S3 > 'your bucket' > Permission > Access control list 
     2. go to 'Public access'
     3. Click 'every one'
     4. select the permissions in 'Access to the objects'
     Done
     OR
      AWS > S3 > 'your bucket' > 'your file' > Action > Make Public
  For new one:-
     For new upload: At a time of upload at permission page just chose 'Manage public permissions' to 'grant public read access'	
        [There is only 2 option to choose 'grant public read access' and 'do not grant public read access']	
        >> This will automatically select option 'List Object' but not 'write Object'
	

  MAnaging named/user Access via ACL of bucket :-
      Providng public/anonymus acceess of bucket is widely user ACL feature. ACL can also allow or deny the permission of certaion
      operation for Other AWS account, Grou, User etc. 
      But ACL itself is an LEGACY system, so aws do not recommend to overuse ACL.
      detail ??????????????????????
      So i am not going much deeper in ACL instead we will more focus on 2 widely use 
      IAM Policy
      Bucket policy
      
     
Block-Public-Access-feature and ACL conflict :-	
      Now you have 4 chack box in BPAF, 2 for BP and 2 for ACL.	
      So	
      The access granted by ACL could be overriden by BPAF, if the two check box of BAPF belongs to ACL are checked.	

      If you have checked 2 ACL checkbox of 'Block-Public-Access-feature':-	
        It means you have blocked all the Anonymuus public access granted via ACL. this will completely override all the accesses granted throug APA.	
        So api A1, A2, A3 will not work  	

      If you have un-checked 2 ACL checkbox of 'Block-Public-Access-feature':-	
        In this case this permission filter is completely shut off. So all the permission granted through APA will be honoured.   	
        So A1, A2, A3 will work	

     Scenarion #1: 	
      You have a bucket where Block-Public-Access-feature = 2 ACL un-checked (so block all public access via ACL turned off). 	
      and you have many files/object in this bucket that are either have APA = granted or APA = denied	
      So what happed if I change 	
          Block-Public-Access-feature = 2-ACL checked  (so block all public access via ACL turned on). 	
      - Here the 'Block-Public-Access-feature' will override the permisssions granted through APA. and so no one will be able to read the #URL_2	
     Scenario#2: 	
      You have a bucket where Block-Public-Access-feature = 2 ACL un-checked (so block all public access via ACL turned off). 	
      So what happed if I upload a and set APA = granted/denied ? 	
      Both case are fine, AWS system will let you do it. No error will come.	
    Scenario#3:	
      You have a bucket where Block-Public-Access-feature = 2 ACL checked (so block all public access via ACL turned on). 	
      So what happed if I upload a and set APA = granted/denied ? 	
      Only APA = denied, will work granted will give error, that is because you cannot upload the file with publicaly accessible setting 	
      when the bucket itself deny any public access.	
      Also what happen if i change the existing file/obect to APA = granted, The option will remain disabled actully.	
      You cannot set the file APA to publically accessible if bucket deny any public access.	     
     
     
ACL over Object :-

S3 and Bucket Policy :-
	
  
  
    
----------------------------
S3 and IAM Policy :-
    
    Predefined IAM Policy :-
        Whenever you creat an IAM user via root user or faderated user, and if you wants this user to be able to do certaion operation on S3
        then you must attach hime with a policy.
        There is two such IAM policy:-
        Scenaro#1 : assigm him none :- USer will not see any thing on his S3 home page.
        Scenaro#2 : attach him with 'S3ReadOnlyPolicy' - 
            He will be able to see the list of bucket. but not able to create new bucket or delete existing one.
            Will he be able to add/remove/delete the objects inside the Bucket:
                - YES! as long as ACL and BP of that bucket are allowing it.
        Scenaro#3 : attach him with S3FullAccess: 
                He will be able to see the list of bucket. also able to create new bucket or delete existing one.
                Will he be able to add/remove/delete the objects inside the Bucket:
                    - YES! as long as ACL and BP of that bucket are allowing it.
    Custom IAM Policy:-

The API getway provide you the way to write an API.

Lets say you wants to have an api which will take userid and return the user detail.
Also it has an third party authorization and all the data lie in another server(not in aws)

For servverless arch you should write small picess of runnable code and deploy them as lembda function

writre one lembda function which will take input as 'accessToken' and 'domainUrl' [assume- accessToken has all ids for user too]

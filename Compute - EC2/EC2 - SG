Security Of EC2 instance:-
    This is most critical part of EC2, Security of EC2 is implemented via Security group attached to EC2 
    Security group is nothing but a kind of firewall around EC2, that decide who can communicate to EC2 and who cannnot.
    
    ## Read Network Traffic Protocol ### in notes.txt    
    Over the network there is multiple way to connect the EC2 with external system
    1. If EC2 is linux based instance then we can use SSH (at port 22 of EC2)
    2. If EC2 is window based instance then we can use RDP (at port 22 of 3892)
    3. Connect EC2 (any based) with internet traffic with HTTP and HTTPS ( on port 80 or 443)
    4. POP, SMTP ....etc.       

    You have to set-up the InBound rule for this security group, this inbound rule will tell 
    what kind of traffic (SSH, RDP, HTTP...)
    And generated by whome (By which IP)
    are allowed to listen by EC2 instance
    
    EG:   Allow listening of SSH traffic from 1.2.3.4, but not other
          Allow listening of RDP traffic from 1.2.3.5, but not other
          Allow listening of RDP and SSH traffic from 1.2.3.*, but not other
          Allow listening of HTTP traffic from 1.2.*.*, but not other
          .....hell lot of combination possible...
       
   Selection of sourcce IP:-
          
          To allow which particular IP is allowed to connect to EC2 and whoich is not you should pass a 
          kind of regular expression of IP address.
          EG: 
              0.0.0.0/0, ::/0    :   will allow all the IP address to connect to EC2 via selected protocol
              0.0.0.0/0, ::/0    :   will allow all the IP address to connect to EC2 via selected protocol
              113.193.134.22/32  :   will allow all the 113.193.134.22 to connect to EC2 via selected protocol
              113.*.*.*/32       :   will allow all matching IPs to connect to EC2 via selected protocol
        This is CIDR notation of IP. Will study it later

Securing the connection: 
   Once the connection is established with EC2(linux, window any type) with another system (window based, linux based etc..) via any 
   protocol (SSH, RDP, HTTP etc..)
   The next thing comes is to make the communication safe and non penetrable.
   Whatever you both talking, nobody in the network should be able to decode it.
   
   For this we will study diffrent cases
   1.     Securing SSH for EC2 linux-instance and any remote client
   2.     Securing RDP for EC2 window-instance and any remote client
   3.     Securing HTTP and HTTPS
   ...etc
   
   Securing SSH and RDP: For this aws provide PPK based encryption. The EC2-instance will encode all the thing via public key
   and the peer we be able to decode it with its private key (correct one).
      For detail on SSH: read ssh.txt
      For detail on RDP: Study later
   
Outbound rule of security group: it will tell to whome the EC2 can iniate the communication [will see later] ????

  Instances associated with a security group can't talk to each other unless you add rules allowing the traffic 
   (exception: the default security group has these rules by default).

Monitering via cloudwatch:-
    EC2 is very heavily integrated with Cloudwatch.
    EC2 send detail data metric to the cloudwatch that you can view in the cloudwatch page of you AWS console.
   in EC2 the cloudwach by defult provide info about
          CPU 
          Network 
          Disk IO
          Status
      But by default it does not moniter 
          Disk usages [Disk Swap Utilization, disk space utilization]
          RAM utilization
        To moiter this two you need to have the custom metric.

       How to view this metric
        AWS > CloudWatch > MEtrics > EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics > search with instance ID 
        You can see many metrics there and see diffent performance indicator.
      
      Detailed Monitoring:-
          By default the performance data form the EC2 is monitered in every 5 minut. but you can enable the detail monitering.
          If you enable it then data wil be monitered in every 1 minute.
          for this:
            AWS > EC2 > Instances > you instace > Action > 'Per-Instance Metrics' > yes
          IMP: this is chargable.
          This will also moniter the default data metric only but more frequently.

      Custom metrics:-
        TRhis is the metric of performance data that are not by default monitor by the clouwact.
        user have to set it up by himself.    
        How?
          1. The first thing you need is to get the EC2 special permission via a policy called ''
              So create a Role for EC2 that has the policy '' attached and attach this role to your EC2 instance.
          2. install the unified cloudwatch agent in your EC2 instance via below commands
          3. Configure unified CW agent
            
            
          High Resplution Custom Metrincs:-
            This metrics can be have data in 10 second grangularity. Be alert to use it as it may skyroket your CW bill.

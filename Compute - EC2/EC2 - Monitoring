Monitering via cloudwatch:-
    EC2 is very heavily integrated with Cloudwatch.
    EC2 send detail data metric to the cloudwatch that you can view in the cloudwatch page of you AWS console.
   in EC2 the cloudwach by defult provide info about
          CPU 
          Network 
          Disk IO
          Status
      But by default it does not moniter 
          Disk usages
          RAM utilization
        To moiter this two you need to have the custom metric.

       How to view this metric
        AWS > CloudWatch > MEtrics > EC2 > Per-Instance Metrics > search with instance ID 
        You can see many metrics there and see diffent performance indicator.

      By default the performance data form the EC2 is monitered in every 5 minut. but you can enable the detail monitering.
      If you enable it then data wil be monitered in every 1 minute.
      for this:
        AWS > EC2 > Instances > you instace > Action > 'Per-Instance Metrics' > yes
      IMP: this is chargable.
      This will also moniter the default data metric only but more frequently.

      Custom metrics:-
        TRhis is the metric of performance data that are not by default monitor by the clouwact.
        user have to set it up by himself.    
        How?
          1. The first thing you need is to get the EC2 special permission via a policy called ''
              So create a Role for EC2 that has the policy '' attached and attach this role to your EC2 instance.
          2. install the cloudwatch in your EC2 instance via below commands
                    yum update -y
                    sudo yum install -y perl-Switch perl-DateTime perl-Sys-Syslog perl-LWP-Protocol-https perl-Digest-SHA.x86_64
                    cd /home/ec2-user/
                    curl https://aws-cloudwatch.s3.amazonaws.com/downloads/CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip -O
                    unzip CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip
                    rm -rf CloudWatchMonitoringScripts-1.2.2.zip
              TIP:: you may wants to put this script in user data for auto install.
              After running this commands in the /home/ec2-user/ directory you  will be able to see a folder name 'aws-scripts-mon'
              in this folder there is coulple of file, we do not need to go in detail of all those.
              But there is one file nameed 'mon-put-instance-data.pl'
              This has necessary script (in perl) to push the data metrics at cloudwatch. we need to run this script
            3. lets say our custom data metrics is for memory utilization, memory used and memory available.
                So to send the data about this metric to cloud watch use below command
                  /home/ec2-user/aws-scripts-mon/mon-put-instance-data.pl --mem-util --mem-used --mem-avail
             4. Now the EC2 will send the data to Cloudwatch and after some time you can see this metric at cloudwatch page
                How much time it take?
                  if EC2 has only statdared monitering then it may take 5 mnt. but if its detail then may be only 1.
                Where to see this metric:
                  AWS > CloudWatch > MEtrics > in Custom Namespaces > Linux System
                you can see this three data there.

            VIMP: This is only one moment monitering means datais ent for this metric is for an specific moment when the command ran.
                  if you wants to send the data again then you have to re-run this command. 

           Custom metrics with Crone job:-
            As you know that above command send the data only when it ran. so for continous monitering the best approach is to
            add this command in crone job
            How?
              its not in scope here.

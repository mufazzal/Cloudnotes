Say you have a use case:-
  There is a 20 EC2-webservers running which has many user created files in its EBS volume. 
  Now all the EC2 must have access to those user created files.
  But files lies only in respective EC2's EBS-Volume.
  But you wants to share the files among the running EC2s.
  How you do it:-
    - Copying files in each of EBS is not very good idea
    - Multi attach EBS has many limitation
  EFS lie in the VPC. so you need to select one when you create it.
   
 For this comes the EFS (Elastic file system)
 EFS is the file system that can be attcahed to many EC2 instances at a time and it automatically grow and shrink in size based on avilabale empty space in disk.
 So you can place the user-created imgaes in the Elastic file system and so all other EC2 who has the EFS attached can use it.
 Also incase of low on remaining space, the size of EFS automatically increase.
 
 
 EFS VS EBS 
  - EFS has auto grow/shrink
  - attchabke to many EC2
  
 EFS VS S3:-
  One is blockk other is object storage.
  EFS has very high througput and IOPS.
  
  
Mouting the EFS on EC2:-
  You can mount it on EC2 by ssh in EC2 and run command
  sudo mount -t efs -o tls <FS id>:/ efs
  
Mounting the EFS on VPVC Endpoint:-
  ????????????????
  
When you create the EFS you must select proper AZ and SG so that the EC2s can communicate with them.

SG set up:-
  At NFS side:
    The SG must allow INbound NFS traffic on port 2409 from SG of EC2s
  At EC2:-
    The EC2 must allow the Outboud on 2049. 


###VIMP: EFS only work for Linux instace not windows.

For windows instace you can use Windows-FSx

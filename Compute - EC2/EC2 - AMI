An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance	
An AMI includes the following:
          - One or more EBS snapshots
          - Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
          - A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.          
          
      Creating AMI from EC2-    
          You can create a AMI from the instance. the AMI will take the Snap of 
          attached EBS + OS + Software installed + Software Configuration
          and store it as AMI in S3.
          When you create an AMI from EC2 then the snapshots of each attached EBS-Volume will be created.
          So AMI = EBS-Snapshot + OS + Software + Configs
          You can see your AMI in EC2 > AMI

          Creating instace via AMI:-
          On AWS consolse when you create a EC2 you can select the AMI you created in step 1.
          The below thing thing will be copued to new instance
          1. OS
          2. Virtlization type HVM or ??
          3. EBS from the snapshots of that AMI
                    - Here the root EBS can not be deselected but other mounted EBS can be deselec.
                    - For each EBS-snapshot a volume will be created and will be attached to launched EC2.

          What about Type: t2.micro etc. This do not come from AMI. you should select it as your requirment

          Say you have a EC2(Orignal) running which has some files and software installed.
          What will be the start state of any EC2 created for AMI of the orignal EC2 
          
Instance		  root files     EC2-user files		start-script		node	apache	web-server Running
Orignal		          Yes		Yes	        	Yes	          	Yes	Yes	Yes						
Via AMI   	          Yes		Yes			No		   	Yes	Yes	No

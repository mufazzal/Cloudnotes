An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance	
An AMI includes the following:
		- One or more EBS snapshots
		- Launch permissions that control which AWS accounts can use the AMI to launch instances.
		- A block device mapping that specifies the volumes to attach to the instance when it's launched.          

		Creating AMI from EC2-    
				You can create a AMI from the instance. the AMI will take the Snap of 
				attached EBS + OS + Software installed + Software Configuration
				and store it as AMI in S3.
				When you create an AMI from EC2 then the snapshots of each attached EBS-Volume will be created.
				So AMI = EBS-Snapshot + OS + Software + Configs
				You can see your AMI in EC2 > AMI
				By default EC2 will stop and then AMI is created and then EC2 will start again. but you can chose the 'No Reboot' option to avoid this.
				but 'No Reboot' option may give you un working AMI 

				Creating instace via AMI:-
				On AWS consolse when you create a EC2 you can select the AMI you created in step 1.
				The below thing thing will be copued to new instance
				1. OS
				2. Virtlization type HVM or ??
				3. EBS from the snapshots of that AMI
									- Here the root EBS can not be deselected but other mounted EBS can be deselec.
									- For each EBS-snapshot a volume will be created and will be attached to launched EC2.

				What about Type: t2.micro etc. This do not come from AMI. you should select it as your requirment

				Say you have a EC2(Orignal) running which has some files and software installed.
				What will be the start state of any EC2 created for AMI of the orignal EC2

	AMI Sharing:-
		By default AMI is used only in the account in which its created but you ca
		- Share it with specific AWS account
		- with piblic
		By CLI:-
		aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --launch-permission "Add=[{UserId=123456789012}]"
		aws ec2 modify-image-attribute --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --launch-permission "Add==[{Group=all}]"

	AMI and Region:-
		AMI are region specific, you can create EC2 out of AMI only in the region where AMI lies. Though you can copy AMI from one region to other region.
	  
          
Instance		  root files     EC2-user files		start-script		node	apache	web-server Running
Orignal		     Yes						Yes	        			Yes	          Yes		Yes				Yes						
Via AMI   	   Yes						Yes								No		   			Yes		Yes				No

-------------------------------

Export/Import VM:-
	This is a useful service which is used to migrate the Virtual MAchines to and from On-premise and Cloud.
	- You can create the AMI from your on-premise virtualization environment and Later you can use this AMI to launch the EC2.
			This is very helpful to migrate the On-premise machines to Cloud.
			Steps:-
				1. Create VM image formm machine of On-premise say [mufImage.ova]
				2. store this in S3 and run comand
						aws ec2 import-image --description "My server VM" --disk-containers "file://C:\import\containers.json"
						containers.json :-
							[{
									"Description": "My Server OVA",
									"Format": "ova",
									"UserBucket": { "S3Bucket": "my-import-bucket", "S3Key": "vms/mufImage.ova"}
							}]
							This will create the AMI.
				3. Use the AMI created above for launching EC2. 
	- You can also create the VM image from EC2 and use this image to create the machine in on-premise.

AMI of Instance store attached Instance:-
	ThisAMI will not have data of Instance store.

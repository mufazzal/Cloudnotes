Just like the EBS is a Physical HDD for storage
The ENI is Physical device for Networking.

ENI (Elastic Network Interface):-
  The ENI is a NEtwork Card in the VPC that is attached to instances running in the VPC.
  The ENI is the main part for networking in EC2.
  The ENI establish the rule and rechability of EC2.
  By default when you create the EC2 a primary ENI is also created and attached to that EC2.
    - the SG you attach to EC2 is actully apply at the Primary ENI created in scope of that EC2. 
    - the IPs (public and private) is actully apply at the Primary ENI created in scope of that EC2. 
    - The default primary ENI can have a public IP assigned antomatically if subknet allow it.
		-	You can assosiate additional private IP to the ENI and for each private IP you can also map a public IP via Elastic IP. 
    
Private IPv4 and ENI:-
  By default ENI has one private IPv4 address attached to it. but you can assosiate more IPv4 address from the CIDR of the VPC.
  to add new private IP use 'ec2 assign-private-ip-addresses '
  
Public IPv4 and ENI:-
  The ENI can have one and only one public IP assosiated. Though you can change it but you cannot add or remove.
  When its created first time (excepr primay ENI of newly created EC2) it does not has any public IP. you can assosiate it later.
	If it has the public IP then this public IP must be assosiated with another private IP (by default the public IP is assosiated to primary private IP)
  also you can then again change the public IP with 'ec2 associate-address '

	For any ENI the IPS look like below:-

		primary_private_IP_1 [cant be deassosiated from ENI]	<---------->	public_ip		[By default mapped to primary_private_IP_1 but can be changed]
		private_IP_2 [can be deassosiated from ENI]					
		private_IP_3 [can be deassosiated from ENI]
		private_IP_4	
	
	EIP and ENI:-
		You can attach one or more then one EIP to the ENI. Each EIP must be assosiated with one private IP.	

Creating ENI:-   
	Though you can attach the additional ENI in the EC2 if you need ore complex Networking operations. 
  You can create and configure network interfaces in your account and attach them to instances in your VPC
		When you creat an EC2 by default a single ENI(Primary ENI) device is attached to that EC2. This ENI device will give following service to EC2
			- One public IPv4 address (if allowed)
			- at least One(Primary private IP) or more private IPv4 addresses from the CIDR range of your VPC
			- A MAC address
			- One or more security groups
			A primary private IP and public IP of ENI is mapped with each other. 

		When you create the new ENI at ENI page in console then it will have
			- No public IP
			- only one private IP (primary)

	For creating ENI you need to have decesion on
		1. Subnet: The ENI will lie in this subnet and will be attacahble to any EC2 in this subnet only. Also it will get an Private IP from pool of CIDR of this subnet
		2. SG: You will be able to select only the SG that are in the VPC of above selected Subnet.
				This SG will later determimne the traffic flow accessibility in and out of this ENI.
		3. Private IP: You can left it empty to auto assign or fill by yourself with proper value from Subnet CIDR.
  
Monitoring IP traffic
  Simply enable VPC flow log on your network interface and then you can see monitered data in cloudwatch
  
Use cases:-
	The MAnagemant networ:-
		You can create a additional ENI which will allow the traffic inside the VPC and by SSH only and let primary ENI gave allower the traffic from internet.
		So you can have better secured network syste.
		So just create ENI with proper SG and with private IPv4 (no need of public IPv4) and attach it to EC2.
		Now use the IP from secondry ENI for management tasks.
	For failover:-
		Have a secodry ENI for traffic. now in case the EC2 failed then simply detach and re-attach the secndory ENI to standby EC2.
      
If my EC2 is doing lot of networking task then should i add more and more ENI:-
  No! the ENI is the building block for Logical Network building. it should not be us for more throuhghput. for this use EN.
  
  
		
--------------------

ENI and EC2 limits:-
  Though you can therotically assign many ENI to the EC2 and eac EC2 can have numerous private IP but practically there is limit
  There is limit on how many of the ENI can be attached to the EC2 and How many private IPs each of ENI can have for working properly.
  EG:-
  t2.micro can attach with only two ENI and each of that ENI can have only 2 private IP.
  so basically it can collectivly have 4 private IP and max 2 public IP (one for each)
  
  
  Arch:-
  Say you have one EC2 and that is is design such that it has 
  2 ENI attached (1 of them could be primary ENI)
    ENI-pub: one for internet traffic 
      - this will have a Security Group SG1 as that it allow Inboud:HTTP:80
    ENI-main: one for maitainance trafic 
       - this will have a Security Group SG2 as that it allow Inboud:SSH:22
    So you can simply decuople you mainainance and public traffic to diffrent ENI.       
      one will allow SSH and other will allow HTTP. though you can cahnge the SG setting if you wants to cahnge the inbound and outbound on each ENI.
                  
                  
                  ENI_pub  = 10.1.1.1  <---> 55.4.4.4, 10.2.2.2

    In above syatem you can have two public IP and theorotically any number of private IP with a single EC2. 

  
  
EC2 - ENI and VPC:-
	The ENI is the actual Network component of EC2 and the ENI of EC2 do has to lie in a subnet of VPC.
	ENI cannot exist without VPC.
	But the EC2 Computing unit not actully lies in VPC. It lies outside the VPC.
	But the defaultly attched iremovable ENI make it apear to live whole EC@ in subnet.
	
	Now amazingly you can attach multiple ENI with the EC2 conmputing unit.
	Even its also possible that two ENI livingf in two diffrent subnet can point to a same EC2 computing unit.
	Therby a sigle EC2 can live in two diffrent subnet.
        though a single ec2 can have multiple eni in different subnet but those subnets must lie in same AZ of default ENI.
		
-----------------------------------------

EN: Enhanced network:-
  The EN provide you better network throughput. you can enable or disable it on EC2. This provide higher bandwidth, higher packet-per-second on low CPU time.
	- It uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV)
	- This is supported on specific instance types not on all.
	- To enable it the instance must be in stopped state.
	- This is not a replacement of Primary ENI. Primary ENI will have to be attached with EC2.
  
  This is of two type-
    1. ENA: Enhanced Network Adapter - provide up to 100 GBps
    2. VF: Virtual function - provide up to 10 GBps

-------------------

EFA: Elastic Fabric adapter:-
  This is useful for ultra high throughput like machine lerning or Big data and HPC apps. EFA provides lower and more consistent latency and higher throughput.
	An EFA is an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) with added capabilities. It provides all of the functionality of an ENA, with an additional OS-bypass functionality
	Basicaly it remove linux karnel and communication occure between program and network hardware.
	- This is supported on specific instance types not on all.
	- To enable it the instance must be in stopped state.
	- It support Message Passing Interface (MPI) 
	- EFA OS-bypass traffic is limited to a single subnet. EFA traffic cannot be sent from one subnet to another. 
		Normal IP traffic from the EFA can be sent from one subnet to another
	- This is not a replacement of Primary ENI. Primary ENI will have to be attached with EC2.
	- OS-Bypass is not supported in window and EFA behave like noral ENI with window instances.

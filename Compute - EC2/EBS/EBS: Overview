The EBS is like a Hard disk device attach to the EC2. This is Raw formatted BLOCK STORAGE. 
The EBS is the Memory attached to the EC@ at extremly nearest location.
The EBS can be used (without any alternative) for installing OS, DB, Software on EC2 machine.
An EBS can be attach to ant EC2 that lie in same AZ only. 
becoz it need to have extremly low latency between EC2 processer and Physical EBS device.
EBs is very useful in system where you need lot of read and write(by throughput) on certain DB or filesystem.

Features:-
  1. Data Redundency: Behind the scene AWs replicated the EBS to diffrent hardwares(In same AZ) in case one component failed for improved data redundency
  2. In live enviormet you can change below properties of EBS whithot detaching from instance
      Storage type, Storage size, IOPS capacity.
  3. Encryption: This is well integrated with KMS for encryption at rest. 

Why not S3:-
  S3 is suitable for storing objects. and it have way to low throuhput and high latency when compare to EBS.

Type of EBS :-
  1. SSD
      1.1 GP2 : General Purpos SSD:- 
          balanced price, good performance
          Best for : general purpose, Virtual desktops, System boot volumes, Development and test environments
      1.2 IO1 : Provisioned IOPS SSD:- 
          Highest performance, High price. 
					When You need more transaction per seconds and transactions is smaller in size [So IOPS is dominant parameter] 
          Best for: mission-critical, low latancy and high throuput work. best for main DB's of your app.
   2. Megnetic
      2.1  ST1 :  Throughput optimize [Data transfer rate in MiB/Sec optimized]
            Low cost - frequently accessed
            Usage: Streaming workloads requiring consistent, fast throughput at a low price
						When You need average transaction per seconds and but transactions are bigger in size [So Throuput is dominant parameter] 
            EG. Big data, Data warehouses, Log processing
     2.2   SC1 :  Cold HDD  
            Lowest cost - less frequently accessed 
            Best for file server.	
     2.3 	 EBS Magnetic:
              Legacy

		Throughput  VS  IOPS:-
			Throughput means data transfer rate. 	How faster it can transfer the data for each IO. 	No matter how may IO take place in each second.
				So it must be better if you need big size of output data in eacg IO
			IOPS means Input/Output per sec. 			How many IO it can do in each second. 						No matter how big or small the output size of data in each IO.
				So it must be good if you need lot of IO operation in each second.

    IMP:-
      SC1 and EBS Magnetic cannot be used as root device. 

    #							GP2								IO1						ST1									SC1
    IOPS					3 to 16000 IOPS		64000 IOPS		500IOPS
    Throughput		250MiB/sec				1000MiB/sec		500MiB/sec
    Multi-attach	No								Yes or No			No	


	EBS Optimized instance:-
		Suppose you wants to use the provision IOPS for high IOPS operation. The EBS you have provision give you high IOPS and throuput 
		But what about the compute unit. it may be possible that this compute unit do not have way to take advatage of this EBS speed.
		For this comes a EBS-Optimized EBS
		In some of the instance type you can enable this feture called 'EBS-Optimization' at launch or after launch.
		If you enable it, the instance uses the optimized stack which give additional capacity of EBS-IO

	Multi Attach Enable Volume:-
		There is way to anable the multi attach so that we can attach the single EBS to multiple EC2.
		It Enables you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volume to up to 
			16 Nitro-based instances that are in the same Availability Zone
		- Multi-Attach enabled volumes can't be created as boot volumes
		- You can't enable or disable Multi-Attach after volume creation.
		-	You can't change the volume type, size, or Provisioned IOPS of a Multi-Attach enabled volume.
		
-------------------------------

IOPS Calculation for EBS:-

	GP2 IOPS:-
		GP2 is useful when you do not know the load on your database. 
		The IOPS of GP2 disk depend on allocated disk size [not used disk szie]
		For higher storage allocation you will get more IOPS.

		Minimun IOPS you will get is 100 IOPS.
		So if your allocated storae is  < 33.33 GB then you will get 100 IOPS.
		after that you gate 3 additional IOPS for each 1 GB allocation.

		So performance of your RDS instance increase with allocated size.
		See table for detail:-	
			Storage		storage*3		IOPS allocated
			1							3					100
			5							15				100
			30						90				100
			33.33					100				100
			100						300				300
			200						600				600
			500						1500			1500
			1000[1TB]			3000			3000
			2TB						6000			6000
			5TB			 		 ~16000		 ~16000


		What if you need more IOPS performance then allocated. 
		In that case IOPS Credit comes in picture.
	
	IOPS Credit:-
		When your RDS instance is created you will get the 5.4 million IOPS credit.
		This credit get used when limit of allocated IOPS reached for RDS instance.
		Now the IOPS balance will also start to accumlating for each second the RDS is up and running.
		So if	
			rate of accumlation > rate of depletion then you may face latency at some point of time as your all iops credit get finish
				and you stuck to baseline performance.
			rate of accumlation < rate of depletion	then you may be using more IOPS rate then allocated but yet system will remain healthy.

	Provisioned IOPS:-
		IF you need the consistent IOPS capacity and do not want to rely on all those if and buts.
		Then simply use Provisionde IOPS. This will cost you high but give you consistent performance.
		You can select how much IOPS you need,
		Maximum IOPS of 64,000 is guaranteed only on Nitro-based instances that are on the m5, r5, and z1d instance types. 
					Other instance families guarantee performance up to 32,000 IOPS

	Ultra high IOPS:-
		If you need IOPS > 64000 or in milliions iops oer sec. 
		Then you have to go for InstanceStore.

The alternative to EBS-Volume is to Instance Store.
With any Ec2 you can either use Instance store or EBS. not both
- This is the Ephameral storage of Ec2 instance. this exist only when EC2 is in start mode.
- The Ec2 with instance store as root cannot be stoped. it can either be start or terminated.
- once terminated all the data in the EC2 instance store will vanish.
- Instance Store can be attach ata time in EC2 launch only. it cannot be add later.
- This gives you insanly high IOPS up to millions IOPS per sec.
- To create AMI from instance store you have to use OS command with ALI tool. not possible with console, sdk or CLI.	
- Instance store backed Instances cannot be upgraded
- It can attached as root or additional device but only at launch time not after instance is started or stopped.
- This is slower to boot then EBS
- For EC2 instance store-backed instances AWS recommends to:
    1. Distribute the data on the instance stores across multiple AZs
    2. Back up critical data from the instance store volumes to persistent storage on a regular basis

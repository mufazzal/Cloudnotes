The alternative to EBS-Volume is to Instance Store.  This is the Ephameral storage of Ec2 instance. this exist only when EC2 is in start mode.
With any Ec2 you can either use Instance store or EBS. not both
- It can attached as root or additional device but only at launch time not after instance is started or stopped.
- This gives you insanly high IOPS up to millions IOPS per sec as well as Througput with ultra low latency.
- To create AMI from instance store you have to use OS command with ALI tool. not possible with console, sdk or CLI.	
- This is slower to boot then EBS
- For EC2 instance store-backed instances AWS recommends to:
    1. Distribute the data on the instance stores across multiple AZs
    2. Back up critical data from the instance store volumes to persistent storage on a regular basis

Instance store as root or additiona device:-
  - once terminated, Stopped, Hibernated all the data in the EC2 instance store(either root or non-root) will vanish.
    
Instance store as root:-
- The Ec2 with instance store as root cannot be stoped. it can either be start or terminated.
- Instance store backed Instances cannot be upgraded [cannot change the instance type]

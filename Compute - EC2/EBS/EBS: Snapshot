You can take the snapshot of any Attached EBS-volume at any point of time. The snapshot is just a bit-by-bit copy of 
attached volume. this copied file then stored in S3 with some special formate.
The snapshot will just preserve the state of EBS at the point of taking the snap.
The snapshot are stored in S3(in the same region) but can be viewed in Ec2 > Snapshots.
How to make it-
  EC2 > EBS > Snapshot > Create
  Here you can create by Instance or by Volume.
  IF you choose 'Volume', then a copy of that EBS volume will be created in S3.
  Volume belongs to a single Disk so a one and only one snap shot will be created.
  IF you choose the Instance then, the instance can have multiple EBS(root + other) attached to it.
  So here you can create snapshot of each of them or select from it.
  So one or more than one snap will be created.

  Snapshot is mapped to EBS disk. not the EC2 instance.

  By CLI:-
    use command 'create-snapshots' for creating via EC2 instance
    use command 'create-snapshot' for creating via volume

  EBS Snapshot and Region:-
    You can create the napshot from the EBS-Volume, from EC2 itself or from another EBS-snapshot. 
    The snapshot created from those will stored in S3 and avilable to the region of its creator device(EC2, Volume, EBS-snap).
    Now you can create the volume from that newly created snapshot in any AZ of that region.
    Though you cannot create the volume in another region from this snapshot.
    How to do cross region EBS replicatiion:-
      For this you first has to copy the snapshot in another region first then use the copied snap to create the EBS-Volume.

  snapshots are incremental:-
    It means that each time you create a snapshot of a volume t any point of time. the delta changes in the data
    will be allocated to new memory. rest of the data which are same as previous snaps are actully refered to those 
    previous snap only.
    See at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html#how_snapshots_work

  Creating Volune from Snapshot:-
    You can create the Volume in from the Snapshot in the same region where snapshot lies.
    You can create volune in any AZ but in same region.
    Volumes created from snapshots load lazily in the background. 
      so there is no need to wait for all of the data to transfer from S3 to your volume before the instance can start accessing an attached volume and all its data
      so in start you may face some latency in IO. Volume performance is achieved after all blocks are downloaded and written to the volume

EBS-Snapshot VS Volume:-
The EBS-Snapshot is the photo or bit-by-bit copy of volume at a time of taking that snap. This is stored in S3 but managed in Ec2.
The Volume is the real hard-distk device that either attached toEc2 or ready-to-attached to EC2.

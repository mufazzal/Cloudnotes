Autoscalling is the GERM of AWS.

When you are using EC2 for any computing (like webserver, DB analysis, image processing), you may need to 
add/remove some more instance depending on load on each EC2.

EC2 - Auto scalling is done via configuring two part
  1.  Launch Configuration or Launch Template:-
        Here you decide how your each EC2 instance would look like. its cpu/memory/EBS capacity, bootstrap script, 
        Security Group, SSH-key pair
        Actully setting this up is almost same as launching a new EC2 instance except in the end it will not launche
        it, but save the set up for on demand launch.
        You can either use Launch Config or Template for this. 
        AWS recommend to use Template as it provides the latest feature like Spot Instances, and template versioning also.
  2.  Auto Scalling Group
        This will set the scenario and capacity, that in which condition we should launch the instances and how many of them
        should be launch. Also you set in which AZ they should be launch.
                
        2.1. First you need to select the 'Launch Configuration' you created earlier
        2.2. Then Desired capacity: the number of instances you wants up and running in normal load
        2.3. Then select the VPC, If you wants the launched instances to lie in some other VPC then default one.
        2.4. Then select subnet  -> 
           You have to select at leat one Subnet in which you wants your instances to launch. always select more then one subnet for higher availibility.
        2.5 LB: Connecting Auto Scalling and Load Balancing:-
             You can desigen the Auto-Scalling-Group in such a way that the launch instances in scalling group will auomatically get attached to a Load balancer.
             For this you have to connect the 'Auto Scalluing Group' [at auto scalling side] to the 'Target Group'[at LB side]
              2.5.1 Click 'Advance'
              2.5.2 Check 'Load Balancing'
              2.5.3 Select the target group[of load balancer] in which you wants to launche th instance.
              
        2.6 Publip Ip for each instance: 
            if you wants each launched instances to have a public IP then youst choose proper options in Advance setting
        2.6 Set the policy:-
              2.6.1 Policy for scalling: Set the condition when the scal up and scale down should happen
                  eg. :  if cpu utilization of each EC2 goes above 90% then sacle up.
              2.6.1 Set How Many Minimum instance you will need at least: This much instance will always be avaialable
              2.6.2 Set How many Maximum instance you can bear: Set one by one how many instance the system can create if situtation demand autoscalling
        7 Select some ore things like tah and all.
        DONE
        Once you are done, the EC2 instances will launch automatically and at the begining the number of instances launched 
        will be equal to value choosed in step 2.2
                      
        All Tuning eg:
         in normal time number of instances = value choosed in step 2.2
         if policy break an need more capasity (eg: if cpu utilization of each EC2 goes above 90% ) then sacle up
         and launch new instances. launch one at a time till you reach at point where no of running instances  =  value choosed in step 2.6.1
         Significance of value  choosed in step 2.6.2  ??????????????????
         
         
         IMP : 
            value in step 2.6.1  <= value in step 2.2  <=  value in step 2.6.2
         
       Launch Configuration VS ASG:-  
        The first one tell you how an each instance will look like in itself.
        Second tell you how those instances are arranged in infrastrucre. 
          Like in what VPC, Subnet behide what LB, wil they have public IP etc.
         
              
  AutoScalling and LB: 
    do not confuse the ASL with LB, the ASL is the feature that keep your capacity in check, depending in usage on each instance
      the ASL can kill/invoke the instances.
      For ASL it does not at all matter that what those instance are doing, from whome they are getting the requestes.
      The only thing they see if they are overloaded or underloaded then just kill/invoke few instances.
      
    The LB is the kind of balancer, when a new request comes to LB it check who has least task in its plate and assign the upcoming
      request to him. It will never be able to invoke /kill any instance.
      For LB it does not matter if system are heavily utilized, it will keep sending the requests to it subordinate EC2s even 
      all of them are at 99.99% occupied.
      
      
  --------------
  
  When you create the ASG it immediatly start creating the EC2's to reach for the minimum capacity.
  So it may be not a optimal. you may wants to create ASG but not wants to run the EC@ just now for thi
  go to 
  AWS > EC2 > ASG > 'tour group' > Action > Edit
  in this forn set 'Suspended Processes' to 'Terminate'

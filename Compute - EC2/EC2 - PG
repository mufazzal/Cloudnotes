The EC2 ran in the data centers and are a nothing but a hardware devices stack in the AWS  dat centers.
The AWS provide so detailed functionality that you can configure how and whhere in the stacks the your EC2 shoud instantiate.
By default EC2 service places the instances in any single AZ in such a manner that they are well diversified wrt underline hardware. 
but you can change this behaviour to met your requirment
You can create a PG and place the EC2 instances in it.  This PG can have one of below 3 placement stratagy
1. Clustered Placement Group:-
    - EC2s are placed very close to each other. So close that they are being placed in same stacks and share the same hardware.
        As they are in same hardware cluster, they have very less network latency when communicating with each other.
    - low network latency, high network throughput, or both
    - Useful for high and fast EC2-to-EC2 communication. EG. HPC apps.
    -	The EC2s in such kind of PG remain in single AZ.
      EG: 
        Rack-1 [EC2_1, EC2_2, EC2_3, EC2_4, EC2_5] 	AZ_1
  Capacity Error on Placement Group:-
    Sometime it may possible that you are not able to launch the instance in the existing placement group because the Racks of that PG do not have enough 
    hardware to accomodate new instance. For this you have to stop and restart all the instances again so that they all can be started in another high capacity rack.

2. Spread:-
    -	EC2 are placed in such a manner that they do not share the common hardware and so remain very much isolated (in term of hardware) from each other.
    -	The EC2s in such kind of PG can lie in in single AZ or multiple AZ.
    - Useful for applications that have a small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from each other
    - You can have max 7 instance per AZ. so max insataces you can have in the group = 7 * number of AZ in region
      EG:
        Rack-1 [EC2_1]	AZ_1
        Rack-2 [EC2_2]	AZ_1
        Rack-3 [EC2_3]	AZ_2
        Rack-4 [EC2_4]	AZ_1
        Rack-5 [EC2_5]	AZ_2
3. Partition Placement Group:-
    - This in between Clustered and Partition Placement Group
        Here the CLUSTER of some EC2-instances are placed in isolated PARTITION of hardware. So that failing of one clusted do not impact other partitions.
    - Each partition comprises multiple instances. The instances in a partition do not share racks with the instances in the other partitions
    -	Useful for large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka
    -	The EC2s in such kind of PG can lie in in single AZ or multiple AZ.
    - You can have max 7 Partition per AZ. Max Number of instance in AZ limits by account limit. 
      EG:
        Rack-1 [EC2_1, EC2_4]		AZ_1
        Rack-2 [EC2_2, EC2_3]		AZ_2
        Rack-3 [EC2_5]					AZ_1

You can place the instances in placement group at a time of creating instances or after creation.
Once instance is created then also it can be [but first instance has to put in stopped state]
  - Move to a placement group
  - Move from one placement group to another
  - Remove from a placement group

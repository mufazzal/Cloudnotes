On Demand:
	You pay by usage/hour or per second
	Best For -
		If you do not need any long term contract
		Low Cost
		Short live application

	On-Demand instance Pricing model:-
		You will be charged(for compute power) for strat instance only not for the stop or hibernate instance.
		For started instance you will be charged 
			for minmum 1 minute if up time < 60 sec
			for exact number of second if up time > 60
		EG:
			for up time = 30 sec charges will be for 1 mnt
			for up time = 1 mnt 30 sec charges will be for 1 mnt 30 sec

	On-Demand Capacity Reservations:-
		If you wants to make sure that you will have some capacity always avaialble to use. you can use this.
		Here the charges per hour will be aplied as per on-Demand price. unlike 'Reseved instance' you do not have to go to a long term contract of 1 or 3 year.
		you can cancel it any time if you no longer need it.
		This is very useful if you wants to make sure that you will surely have a instance for small priode of time
		On-damnd capacity can be reserved with below param
		- Number of instances
		- AZ, Type, Tanancy, Platfors 

----------

Reserved:
    You reserve the capasity for a certain time (for a 1 yera to 100s of year).
    You are locked in a contract. AWS generally provide yuo discount if you contract for longer time. You also need to pay some amount upfront.
    This is not a special type of in stance oinstead its just a Discoup applied on bill if below criterion matched
			- User has purchased th reserved capacity
			- The region and instance type of purchased capacity matched the region and instance type of Instance type. 
		Best For -
      App that need steady and predictable usages (So you calculate the computing power well in advance, so pay upfront in advance and get good discount from AWS)
		Pricing:-
			There thre model here
			All Upfront: 			Once paid fully, you wont be charged for using it at all.
			Partial Upfront: 	You pay partial ammount and then you will be charged  with discounted rate for each hour for remaing priode. no matter you are using instance or not. 
			No Upfront: 		You pay full ammount and then you will be charged  with discounted rate for each hour for remaing priode. no matter you are using instance or not. 
		Factor for price determination:-
			1. Instance type(or family)
			2. Region
			3. Tenancy
			4. Platform(Linux/windows)
		Terms:-
			1 or 3 yesr. it does not renew automatically. instead you will start bearing charges for On-Demand
		Offering Class:-
			There is two class here
			1. Standard:-
						Here you can modify the instance but can not convert it
			2. Convertible:-
						Here you can modify and convert the instance.
						
		Regional and Zonal Instance:-
			In regional you have flexibility fir changing AZ and zonal you need select AZ and that cannot be nodified later.
			
		Limit:-
			Max Regional-instance you can reserve = 20
			Max Zonal-instance per AZ you can reserve = 20
		Reserved instance Marketplace:-
			This is like a secondry market of RI. If in case you no longed need the instance then you can sell them here.
		
		Modifing the instace:-
			once purchased you can change some param of the capacity like
			-	Instance Size in same instance Type(family), EG you can chage t2.micro to t2.small or t2.large etc. but cannot chage it to m2.micro. 
			- AZ
			You can also modify a reservation to divide it into two or more reservations. 
			EG: t2.medium instance (2 units). You can divide the reservation into two reservations, 1 * t2.nano instances (.5 units) and 3 * t2.micro instances (1.5 units).
			Below items are not mioifiable, this are all the item that factor into the pricing
				1. Instance type(or family)
				2. Region
				3. Tenancy
				4. Platform(Linux/windows)

		Converting the instance:-
			This will cost you higher but this gave you flexibilty to excahnge the instance with diffrent set of
				1. Instance type(or family)
				2. Tenancy
				3. Platform(Linux/windows)
			Below are the rules:-
				- both the isntaces must be from same region
				- Convertible Reserved Instances can only be exchanged for other Convertible Reserved Instances.
				- You can exchange ONE OR MORE Convertible Reserved Instances at a time for ONLY ONE Convertible Reserved Instance only
				- Total value of instance to be exchange must be  <= 	Total value of new instances for exchange [You can go high or atesame but not low in price scale] 

----------

Saving Plane:-
	Saving plan provide most flexibility in term of usages. you can buy a compute saving plane for 1 or 3 year.
	once purchased you can use it for ECS, EC2, Farget and lambda all.
	This is very useful if you canges your usage among EC2, ECS, Lambda.
	This pricing model offers lower prices on Amazon EC2 instances usage, regardless of 
		- instance type (family), 
		- size, 
		- OS (windows or linux) 
		- tenancy  
		- AWS Region, 
		- also applies to AWS Fargate and AWS Lambda usage
	
	So this has significace advantage over Reserved instances, as it is very flexible and for EC2 it provide flexibility over region, OS and tenenncy too.

-----------

Spot:
	You will be charged bsed in spot price.

----------

Dedicated Host:
	Generally if you need to follow soome regulatory protocols. and you need the physical server dadicated to you only.
	This physically hosted server do lies in AWS building but unlike other EC2, this are solely assign to you.
	Very costly

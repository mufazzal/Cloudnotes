IN AWS system the policy is the nucleas statement of Access.
its strcure remain same everywhere and used in many places in may context of access.

The structure:-

Type of Policies:
  On the whole AWS level we can have below type of policies
  
  AWS Policies

                |
                |
                |-----Bucket Policy                               Attached to one AWS resource |   Has Principle tag   |  Limited Resource tag  |  No ARN    |
                |-----KMS Policy                                  Attached to one AWS resource |   Has Principle tag   |  Limited Resource tag  |  No ARN    |
                |-----SQS  Policy                                 Attached to one AWS resource |   Has Principle tag   |  Limited Resource tag  |  No ARN    |

  
  
  IAM Policy:-
    The IAM Policy use for granting access to 3 type of IAM identity 
    1. IAM Role
          - Therby providing access of underline resources to EC2, LAmbda, RDC, Cognito idp etc
    2. IAM User Group
          - Thereby providing access of underline resources to the IAM user group 
    3. IAM User Group
          - Thereby providing access of underline resources to the IAM user
    
    This three identity behave as 'principle' in structure of policy. that is why in any kind of IAM policy you never need to mention the 'principle' tag.
    The subject in the IAM policy is the IAM Identity. 
  
     Managed Policy:-
        This IAM policies can be attach to as many role, group, user as you wants. So this are reusable policy.
        This policy can be viewed at  AWS Console > IAM > Policies.
        each of this policy do has an ARN so that it can be used elsewhere. 


        Use managed Policy:-
            Via AWS console:-
              ??????
            Via Cloudformation:-
              ?????

       Managed policy is of two type:-
          A. AWS Managed Policy:-
              This are pre-written and non-editable policy which are design by the AWS team for doing some routine task.
              This policy are ready to use policy for providing necessaru access to any IAM identity for doing some task. This policy cannort be added, deleted, edited by IAM user.
              EG
                  S3FullAccess :- provide the role. group, user access to for any thing on S3
                  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess: provide the role. group, user access to of reading any thing on S3
                  AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole:- provide lambda the basic execution right
                  AWSCodeDeployRole: provide necessary access for code deployment
                  ** though it contains Role in the name but they are policy actully. Uff you AWS morones.
          B. Customer Managed Policy:-
              This is same as AWS managed policy but it can be created, edited, deleted by the AWS IAM user himself.
              This is useful when you wants to creat a customized policy by yourself and then reuse it for certain type of IAM identities.

              Creating Customer Managed Policy:-
                 Via AWS console:-
                  ??????
                 Via Cloudformation:-
                  ?????         

     Inline Policy:-
        Inline policy is attached to one and only one IAM identity. It cannot be assign to multiple IAM Identity.
        This do not has the ARN because it is not reusable.
        This is useful when you wants to give access of underline resources to certain IAM identity but not to anyone else. 
          
          Creating Inline IAM Policy:-
             Via AWS console:-
              ??????
             Via Cloudformation:-
              ?????    
                        
            
              
  Resource Based Policy:-
    In the resource based policy the subject is resource and so this policies are assignable to certain kind of AWS-service-resources not the AWS IAM user.
    Here we has the Principle tag in the policy statement that is because you attach the policy to the EC2, Lambda, RDS instances but not on IAM Role, IAM User Group, IAM User.
    But
    We also have the 'Resource' tag in the policy statement. but its scope is automatically narrowed down to the aws-resource it is attached to.
    To craete any such kind of policy first you have to choose the AWS resource on whome you wants this policy t be mounted.
    This policies also do not has ARN because they are not reusable.
    
    Most of the time we see that in this policy the resource tag as
      ...
      Resource : '*'
      ...
    Do not confuse that it will allow the action to any AWS resource. this policy is attaced to a certain resource actully so the scpe of the resource is already narowwed down.
    but you further wants to narrow down the resource then you can use ARN. but this ARN sould only lie in the scope of attaced resource.
    
    Bucket Policy:-
      ?????
    KMS Policy:-
      ??????

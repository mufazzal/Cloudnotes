A listener is a process that checks for connection requests, using the protocol and port that you configure. 
The rules that you define for a listener determine how the load balancer routes requests to its registered targets
Listener must have one default rule that will have least priority. The rule with higher priority execute first and then the lesser one. 

  In case of ALB:
    The ALB can route the traffic to desired target after checking underline requets params. ALB work at Application layer so it has exposure to lot of request detail.
    ALB support only two protocol and ports
      HTTP and HTTPS (not TCP)
      Port: 1-65535    
  In case of NLB:
    NLB work at layer 3 so it do not have access to the request param. so for NLB you can not have diffrent condition check in the NLB.
    Even though if you have it then it will go in vain. 
    NLB support below protocol and ports
      Protocols: TCP, TLS, UDP, TCP_UDP
      Ports: 1-65535

  Default Rule:-
    Each listener must have a default Rule. This rule do not have any condition.
    The Action of This Rule execute if none other rule satisfy their conditions.
    [ IN case of NLB only this rule execute always ]

  Listener Rule:-
    Each listener has a default rule, and you can optionally define additional rules. 
    Listener Rule play Role 
    Each rule consists of a 
      - priority, 
      - one or more actions, 
      - one or more conditions
      
    Action:-
      Once the condition is matched, ALB can perform below action
      ALB can redirect the request to 
        - fixed-response
            The ALB will return the status code (2XX, 4XX, 5XX) with messageBody. 
        - target
            The ALB will redirect the traffic to EC2 target group
        - redirect
            Will redirect to another url

    Condition:-
      ALB can route the traffic based on one of below item in requets. You can use only one of then in each rule.
        host-header
        http-header
        http-request-method
        query-string
        source-ip

     You can take the diffrent action based on the condition match with gived params.

-------------  

It strucre like belo
  ALB
    Listener1 [HTTP:80]
      - Rule 1
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Rule 2
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Rule 3
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Default Action
    Listener2 [HTTP:3000]
      - Rule 1
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Rule 2
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Rule 3
        - Actions
        - Conditions
        - priority
      - Default Action     

-------------
 
  What if first filter not passed EG. the port and protocol of request in not passed
  - then the request goes to not honoured.
  What if second filter doens not pass
  - then every first filter has the default action that will be performed.
 
 Can a request satisfy two first pass:
  - impossible because set of port and protocol is unique amont al listener.
 Can a request satisfy two second pass:
  - Yes. but they ran in order of priority so the first one who has high prority win.
  
------------------------
  
 X-Forwarded-** Header:
   When LB redirect the traffic to other target like EC2 or url, the designated target will take the ALB as source
   so the IP, port and protocol he receive is of ALB
   Then how could the destination will know the Ip, port and protocol of orognal client
   For this the ALB add three extra header in request
      X-Forwarded-For
      X-Forwarded-Proto
      X-Forwarded-Port
  This three will have informarion about how the client connected to the ALB
  
 
  
----------------------------------------------------

 The ALB do the filtering at two stage:-
  First at Listener level based on Protocol and Port [AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener]
  Second at Listener Rule level based on [AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::ListenerRule]
    host-header
    http-header
    http-request-method
    query-string
    source-ip
  Once both are passed then the desired action will be taken.
 The NLB do the filtering at only one stage:-
  At Listener level based on Protocol and Port [AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener]

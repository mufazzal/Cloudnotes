ELB automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones. 
It monitors the health of its registered targets, and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.

There is 3 kind of this
  - Application Load Balancers, 
  - Network Load Balancers, 
  - Gateway Load Balancers, 
  - Classic Load Balancers
  

Think of ELB as the point where you recive and accept the traffic from internet or inside aws and then forwrd this traffic to the point of your choose.

LB has below component common among any type
  SG:-
    The LB has the SG attach which allowinbound and outbound traffic for source and destination. 
    Here you open the port and protocol of LB for incoming traffic and
    allow flow of traffic at outbound for targets.
  AZ:-
    When you create the ALB, You must specify The AZ. Ror this you also have to select the one subnet from that AZ. 
    LB will forward the traffic to that AZ only. so any target leave outside those AZs will not receve the traffic even though he is registered in targt group.
    In case of ALB:
        You have to select the Two Subnet, and each from diffrent AZ.   
    
  Components of ELB:-
    1. Listener:-
        Listeners check the incoming traffic to the LB on Port and Protocol.
        Each listener have coulpe of listener rule that specify on which TARGET to route the traffic bsed on specified CONDITION in that rule. 
        A LB can have the Multiple Listener.
    2. Target Group 
        The target group routes requests to one or more registered targets, such as EC2 instances, using the protocol and port number that you specify.
        TG is attached to any particular Listener as default action or at any Listener Rule.
        The listener route the traffic to port of this TG via specified protocol.
        
    Flow:-
      The Client go to url http://<DNS of ELB>:<port>

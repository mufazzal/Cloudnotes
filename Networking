Why CIDR/Subnet and all requred ?

Suppose you wants to create an app, and that reqired 20 database, 50 EC2 instance, 10 LB etc.
Now for comuunicating all this resources you gave all of them an indivisual public IP.
You ma=y need up 100+ public IP for this. This is too costly and almost impossible to sustain.
Becoz there are only 4 billion IP(IPv4) avaailabe to this universe.

For this come the concept of subnet/CIDR etc.

This things helps you to create a small isolated network.

How its work. 

For this the first thing you need an hardware Router. The router is the most fundamental Part of the network.
The router place in muffy home create a small subnet 
The router place in moiz home create a small subnet 
The router place in murtuza home create a small subnet 

Now its a responsibility of router to assign each one an IP. But How?
If he assign any random ip from pool of all public IP to all 3 devices (my and fattu mobile and TV)
This is unsustainable as it will deplete the bpublic IP pool in fey months.

To solve this problem the concept of class IP came 
Out of around 4 billion IPs cuple of ip address are revreved for creating subnet/private network. A router can use one of those address 
to assign the ip to connected peers.

To formalize and create a common ground for making a router hardware the 'Internet Assigned Numbers Authority' (IANA) come up with
the proposal of reserving lot of IPs for particular usage

##IMP: Earlier the allocation of IPs are done via class (A, B, C, D, E). but now its been done via CIDR.


IANA have resrved following address block for particular usage

10.0.0.0/8  	  10.0.0.0    – 10.255.255.255	2^24  Private network	  Used for local communications within a private network
172.16.0.0/12	  172.16.0.0  – 172.31.255.255	2^20  Private network	  Used for local communications within a private network.[4]
192.168.0.0/16	192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255	2^16	Private network	  Used for local communications within a private network.[4]
100.64.0.0/10	  100.64.0.0  –100.127.255.255		    Private network	  Shared address space for communications between a service provider and its subscribers.
127.0.0.0/8 	  127.0.0.0   – 127.255.255.255	      Host	            Used for loopback addresses to the local host.[3]
192.0.0.0/24	  192.0.0.0   – 192.0.0.255		        Private network	  IETF Protocol Assignments.[3]
224.0.0.0/4	    224.0.0.0   – 239.255.255.255		    Internet	        In use for IP multicast.[11] (Former Class D network).
198.51.100.0/24	198.51.100.0–198.51.100.255	        Documentation	    Assigned as TEST-NET-2, documentation and examples.[7]
192.88.99.0/24	192.88.99.0 –192.88.99.255	  	    Internet	        Reserved.[8] Formerly used for IPv6 to IPv4 relay[9] (included IPv6 address block 2002::/16).
...etc

Now all the router made in world has to take care of this rule and will have to riute the traffic according to this table.

There is three main row in this table (1,2 and 3) This IPs are used for creation of private network. 
If your network has lot of peers then use the router who can support '10.0.0.0/8' CIDR and you can connect up to 2^24 decvices  
If your network has moderate of peers then use the router who can support '172.16.0.0/12' CIDR and you can connect up to 2^20 decvices  
If your network has few of peers then use the router who can support '192.168.0.0/16' CIDR and you can connect up to 2^16 decvices  

In memoth size corporate organization first one is good choce
In medium size organization first one is good choce
In small company or in home network(local broadband router) third one is best

##Note:
127.0.0.0/8 : this CIDR is localhost loop

So lets come to router at homw of moiz, mufazzal and murtuza.

Generally all typical router we use in home give you '192.168.0.0/16' CIDR for private network

                      ------Muf mob----  192.168.0.100

Mufa cann connect up to 2^16 devices in his small 2bhk flat and none of them will be from public IP
Also look how a same IPs are re-used in difftrent private network to optimized the IP pool.
Also The router himself also have one IP address in the private network he created by himself. Most of the time for simple-home-router
this address is '192.168.0.1'. So you can go to this IP via browser for more info.

Router and Public Internet :=-
Till now tyou see how a simple router in muffy home can make a small private netowrk, But till now this small private network is completely isolated form public internet. 
But if muffy pay the tikona bill te tokona can connect this small network to public internet.
The tikona router connect those all small private network to public internet.
All the internet traffice from those device will have to be pass through the router.

Though this router actuly not directly connected to Public internet, instaed they are a small peer in a WAN (Wide Area Network)
There 100s of Router in a one WAN. This  all WAN may have one large router also. lets call them WAN-Router.

The router in muffy, moiz and mur homes are peer in this WAN network and all of them connected to WAN-Router and so all those
home-router will have an IP assosiated with that WAN.
So home-router will have two IPs, one for its private network and one for WAN.
IANA decided to use CIDR CIDR '100.64.0.0/10' to assign to ip for home-router by WAN-router. See the 4th row of reserved IP table.

So the network will look like this now-

 Now look in the above diagram how the IP '100.79.166.24' is used twice, one in pune WAN-network and one in Barnagar WAN-network.
 This IP is from forth row of reserved CIDR ips.
 
 See the address '100.79.160.2' and '100.79.160.1': This are the address that are assign to high level router. 
 This address also are from reverved CIDR block of 4th row.

All the devices connected to the router create a private network.

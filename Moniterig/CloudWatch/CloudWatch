This is monitering PERFORMANCE in services for all your AWS resources and Application
It can monitor EC2, S3, Auto scalling  Group, ELB, Route53, EBSs, Storage getway ETC.

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. 
You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.

With this data in CW you can
  - Create the Custom dashboard for monitering
  - get statistics grapf for system performance
  - Create alarm and notification for specific CW event
  

Concept:- 
  To understand the CW you must know nelow terminology
  
  NameSpace:-
    This is the top level sagregation of monitering data. The data are partitioned in this name space are isolated from eachother
    AWS has unique CW Namespace for each AWS Service
    EG:
      EC2: AWS/EC2
      S3: AWS/S3
      Lambda: AWS/LAmbda.  

    
  Metrics VS Dimention:-
    Metric is the param to be moniter
    Dimension is the way to filtering and indexing those Metrics.

    Metrcis data keep on generating till AWS resource is there.
    Dimesion is the chrachtristic, assosiated at the time of that AWS resource created/Updated.

CW Agent:-

CW Alarm:-

 Time or Rate based CW event:-
  You can create rules that self-trigger on an automated schedule in CloudWatch Events using cron or rate expressions.
  This trigger in interval like
  once a day
  once a month
  once a week etc.
 
 -----------------
 
 
 
 Billing Alarm:-
  It can be created only in us-esast-1. and you can create against whole account or for a specific service.
 
--------
 
CW Log Export to S3:-
  You can simply export the CW logs to S3 and do analysis over there. You can set a CW cron job to do it on regulae interval
  Though it is not real time.
  
CW Log Subscription:-
  You cause susbscription for getting near real time log data.
  For this your subscription client be
  - Alambda
  - KEnesis firehose
  - KEnesis stream
  
 
--------

Access Logs AWS give in hand:-
  LB
  Cloudtrail
  S3
  Route 53
  VPC access log
  
--------
CW Event + Cloudtrail:- 
  For all the AWS serices there exist a event type = "AWS API by Cloudtril" and you can use it to responde on 
  any api call( except Get, List, Describe) done on that service.

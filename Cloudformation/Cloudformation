The cloudforamation in simple word is "Infra AS Code"

This is the way to w4rite complete inra in Jsom or Yaml file. You can write the file or use AWS designer for this.
You can design  EC2, S3, RDS etc with this.
Once the templatebjson or Yaml is created, it can be used anywhere to build whole infra out of this template. 
Its impossible to become master in clouformation and know how cloudformation template can be designed to make EC2, S3 etc.
But you should know the fundamentals

To understand the CloudFormation always remebper there is two party 
one is Creator, who create the template
other is Builder who is building the stack out of template

Creatore create the template as such that the tempplate
has definations of RESOURCES like EC2, S3 etc
has some MAPPING, which are like a function which take one input and return the set of label
has some PARAMETER which are set by Builder at a time of stack building
has OUTPUT, which are final logs of stack creation

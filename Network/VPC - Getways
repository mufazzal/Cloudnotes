Internet Getway:-
  Internet getway provide the internet access to all internal Nodes of VPC.

  Internet Getway perform two IMP task for two diffrent kind of Node:-
    For Node with public IPv4:-
      Work as NAT (Network Address Trasnslator) for Node with Public IPv4 
    For Node without public IPv4:-
      Use rote table to route the internet traffic to the destination node.


  Suppose there is a node that has the public IPv4
    EG: EC2 with IPv4 Enable, RDS with IPv4, NAT Getway
    say the reserved public IP is 87.9.8.7
      Inboud traffic:-
        Say mufazzal Hussain wants to run a API '87.9.8.7/getUsers' from his domain/PC/localhost.
        In that case the request will reach the internet getway and the IG will see its NAT table (not rout table) to get the exact instance that has this IP.
      Outbound traffic:-
        For all such node this work as intermediatory to redirct the response of the request(generated from inside the node) to proper node     

    Suppose there is a node that do not has the public IPv4
      Inboud traffic:-
        Impossible. no one from internet can reach to a node who do not has the public IPv4
      Outbound traffic:-
        For all such node this work as intermediatory to redirct the response of the request(generated from inside the node) to proper node 


  Basically all the internet traffic flow from IG.

  Can a VPC have mutiple IG
  ?????????/

  IG and Route Table:-
    By default any route table do not redirect any internally generated internet traffic to the IG.
    to do this you have to add this entry in Rout Table
      0.0.0.0./0  - igw-*******
    This entry will route the traffic to the internet getway.  
  
NAT Getway:-
  
    Why NAT Getway required
    Suppose you created a web app wirth some public and privatesubnet
    Now public subnet has many EC2-webserevr and as they are assosiated with their public IP they can reached from the public-internet also
    like www.mufifnance.com or ssh 56.34.67.123 etc.
    Now we also have couple of private subnet. This subnet can have manny DB-instace or EC2-instance (for computing)
    those instances are not reacable by ssh or www at all.
    This is fine because we de not wants them to exposed to public-internet.
    But there is a patch-
      Ok! Nobody can reach to Nodes inside private subnet.
      But what if the Node itself wants something from internet? What if they wants to update their OS or patches. 
      Or some computing instance wants to acceess an API from internet?
      To solve this comes a 'NAT Getway'               
    So In nutshell-
        NAT Getway do not allow any InBound comunication initiated from the Public Internet.
        NAT Getway only allow the OutBound communication intiated from withine the subnet
        - NAT getway do allow SSHing in any instace in private subnet instance.

  What you required to create an NAT Getway and Attach it: 
    1. A Public Subnet
        NAT Getway do provide the one-way-initiated public internet access to private Subnet, but the 'NAT Getway' itself 
        reside in the Public Subnet.
    2. A Elastic IP:-
        You must have a EIP to attach to the NAT getway.
          
  NAT Getway and Route Table:-
    By default any route table do not redirect any internally generated internet traffic to the NAT Getway.
      to do this you have to add this entry in Rout Table
        0.0.0.0./0  - nat-*******
      This entry will route the traffic generated in assosiated subnet into to the NAT getway.
      
      
  One NAT Getway can be attached to many route table and so can handle traffic from many Subnets at a time.
  The natgetway by default have 5GBPS bandwith but can scaled up to 45 Gbps.
  So many instances in many private subnet may share this bandwith for nternet access.
  
  If you have multiple private subnet and they all access the internet via single NAT getway, then it may leads to high traffic on it and risk of single point of failure.
  To avoid this its good pactice to have one NAT getway for each private subnet.

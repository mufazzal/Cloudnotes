Internet Getway:-
  Internet getway provide the internet access to all internal Nodes of VPC.

Internet Getway perform two IMP task for two diffrent kind of Node:-
  For Node with public IPv4:-
    Work as NAT (Network Address Trasnslator) for Node with Public IPv4 
  For Node without public IPv4:-
    Use rote table to route the internet traffic to the destination node.
    
    
Suppose there is a node that has the public IPv4
  EG: EC2 with IPv4 Enable, RDS with IPv4, NAT Getway
  say the reserved public IP is 87.9.8.7
    Inboud traffic:-
      Say mufazzal Hussain wants to run a API '87.9.8.7/getUsers' from his domain/PC/localhost.
      In that case the request will reach the internet getway and the IG will see its NAT table (not rout table) to get the exact instance that has this IP.
    Outbound traffic:-
      For all such node this work as intermediatory to redirct the response of the request(generated from inside the node) to proper node     
    
  Suppose there is a node that do not has the public IPv4
    Inboud traffic:-
      Impossible. no one from internet can reach to a node who do not has the public IPv4
    Outbound traffic:-
      For all such node this work as intermediatory to redirct the response of the request(generated from inside the node) to proper node 
      
      
Basically all the internet traffic flow from IG.

Can a VPC have mutiple IG
?????????/

IG and Internet Getway:-
  By default any route table do not redirect any internally generated internet traffic to the IG.
  to do this you have to add this entry in Rout Table
    0.0.0.0./0  - igw-*******
  This entry will route the traffic to the internet getway.

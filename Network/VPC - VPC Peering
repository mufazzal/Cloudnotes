VPC Peering VS Endpoint Service:-
  - VPC peering connect two VPC and allow communication from both direction
    EPS is connection between PRovider and Consumer. consumer can consume the exposed sevice of Provider. not vice versa.
  - Any service in both VPC will be exposed to each other by peering
    Only exposed service of provider will be accessible to consumer
  - If you wants to peer two VPC, they must not have overlapping CIDR block.
    CIDR overlapping doesn't matter

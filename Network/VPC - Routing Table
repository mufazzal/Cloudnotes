When you craete A VPC it will also create a Default Route Table.
  This route table simply has one entery
    10.0.0.0/16   - 	local - 	active	
  Which mns all the internal private IP will be routed to anf from internam components of that VPC.
  Also the internet traffic will be cutted off completely.


one subnet can only connect with one route table
but one route table can be connected to multiple subnet
So its relation is like below

                                Subnet 1      
        Routing Table--------   Subnet 2
                                Subnet 3  

But not like
    
        RT 1------------
        RT 2------------  Subnet 1
        RT 3------------

For each Subnet there is 4 pre-reserved private IPs by AWS for there inmternal Use:-
  This are
    1. ????????????/
    2.
    3.
    4.
  That is why you always see 4 IP less in available IP colum of the subnet.
  
  What is minimum and Maximum possible CIDR block for an Subnet
  ???????????/
    


The NAT getway is not directly connected to Internet Getway 
the internet flow like below
Private subnet connecte to an NAT getway
  - the routable of private subnet has entry    0.0.0.0/0  -   NAT-997838493
NAT Getway lies in a Public Subnet
The Piblic subnet is public because it has an Internet Getway attached
  - the routable of public subnet has entry    0.0.0.0/0  -   IGW-997838493
so that NAT gettway now connect with Internet Getway of Public subnet.

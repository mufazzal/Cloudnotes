Your VPC has an implicit router, and you use route tables to control where network traffic is directed. 
Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a route table, which controls the routing for the subnet (subnet route table)
The routing table is simplly a table which has entery of IP or CIDR against the Node. 
It is actully a master table for all the routing decision happen in Subnet.

When you craete A VPC it will also create a Default Route Table.
  This route table simply has one default unchangable entery
    10.0.0.0/16   - 	local - 	active	
  Which mns all the internal private IP will be routed to anf from internam components of that VPC. Every route table has this entry and it cannot be changed or deleted.
  This also mean that route table make sure each component in each sunbnet can reach to each other component in other subnet.
  route table can never stop it. though u can stop one node to reach to other via DG or NACL.
  The value 16 can be very depend on the CiDR range of the VPC. Also the internet traffic will be cutted off completely.

  one subnet can only connect with one route table
  but one route table can be connected to multiple subnet
	So its relation is like below 				    But not like
                              Subnet 1      RT 1------------
    Routing Table--------			Subnet 2      RT 2------------  Subnet 1
                              Subnet 3      RT 3------------


The entries in Route Table contains 2 main values that define the routing mechanism. one is the IP CIDR range and other is The destination.
The destination could be
  - A Internet getway
  - local [VPC Router]
  - NAT Getway
  - EC2 instance
  - Virtual Private Getway
  - Network Interface
  - Transit Getway
Any IP falling in that CIDR range will be routed to the given destination.  
  
  Generally it has below entries
    10.0.0.0/16	                Local                       -> The default unchangable entry, this make sure that all the IP of type 10.0.***.*** remain inside the selected VPC
    0.0.0.0/0                   <select Internet Getway>    -> If you choose internet getway here then those CIDR block will be redirected to pulic internet
    0.0.0.0/0                   <select NAT Getway>          -> This also enable internet Access but at intiatlted from internal sided only  

Any newly create route table will have at least one entry that is
10.0.0.0/16	                Local  
You cannot delete it or edit it.
  
-------------------------  

Route priority:- 
  For a given IP, if match is between two entried in RT. The one with long prefix match will win.
  10.0.0.0/16	    Local
  172.31.0.0/16	  <rt_1>
  172.31.3.4/32	  <rt_2>
  0.0.0.0/0	      <rt_3>
  If address is '172.31.3.4' then rt_2 will win because prifix is 32. even though the match is in rt_2 and1 and rt_3 as well.
  If address is '172.31.a.b' where a and b != 3 and 4 then rt_1 will win because prifix is 16. even though the match is in rt_3 as well.
  For other if match is '10.0.0.0/16' then Local will win. even though the match is in rt_3 as well.
  For all other '0.0.0.0/0' will win.
  
-----------------------------

Main Route Table:-
	This is tghe default RT created with the VPC and it cannot be delted.
	It has only one entry at creation and that is <VPC_CIDR> : Local
	This RT by default assosiated with Newly created subnet.
	You can add, remove, and modify routes in the main route table

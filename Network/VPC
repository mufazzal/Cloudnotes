VPC as its name suggest is a virtual cloud in the AWS system. think of VPC as fulluy isolated data center inside the your AWS account
An AWS account can have as many VPC as he wants. each is isolated with other. 
The VPC lies one and only one region. Subnets inside that VPC can lie in multiple any AZ of that region. But a single subnet itself lie only in one AZ.


When you create a VPC, below three default things will be create
  1. A default SG for that VPC
      This SG has all traffic of all type open for in and outbound. This SG at this moment is just free floating entity in this VPC because it is not attached to anything 
  2. A default Network ACL
      This NACL has all traffic of all type open for in and outbound
  3. A default Rout Table
      - This has all internal IP routing to internal VPC envirment    '10.0.0.0/16  -  local'
      - This is not route anything to internet.           
             
-------------

DEfault VPC and DEfault Subnet:-
  Every AWS account di have one default VPC and in that default VPC also lie a one default subnet.
  MAny of the nodes we create like EC2, RDS are actully created in that default VPC ans in that VPC it lies in its default subnet.
  You canchange VPC and subnet of your choice if you wants. but by default it lies in default
    
User created VPC and DEfault Subnet:-
  Only default VPC can have default subnet. not other.   
  
---------------------------------------------

Which AWS resources could lie inside the VPC and which cannot:-
  The VPC in very simple term is a network. and network contains node. 
  and every node must have an IP (private is must and public if needed). So this node then will be reachable by thos IPs.
  
  Now what AWS resources could be the Node of the VPC or which could not:-
    You have to be a Node in a network if 
    - You need to communicate with any other node the the network
    - You wants others to reach to you in the network.
    
    EC2: The EC2 isntance has to be a Network Node. It cannot be used without network. Because you can use EC2 only if he has an IP.
      Its impossible to create a EC2 without IP.
      Also EC2 should be reach and can be reachable in the network. 
      
      Thats why you must select the VPC for creating EC2.
      >> SO EC2 will always be a node in VPC.  it cannot live independently.
    
    LB: This also has to be in network. because it need to communicate to EC2s.
        SO LB cant exist outside VPC.
    
    S3: S3 is not a network node. When you create a S3 bucket you can access them via url of that bucket. This bucket do not have any 
      Public or private IP.
      Also Nither the S3 bucket itself ever has to communicate with any of node
      >> SO S3 bucket can never be a node in VPC.
    
    DynamoDB:
      Same as S3. It do not live in VPC.
    
    RDS: RDS also get a public IP (as well as DNS name).
      >> SO RDS will always be a node in VPC. it cannot live independently.
      
    Lambda: This is tricky. 
      Lambda also do not have any IP assosated with it so it live outside VPC.
      But some time you may need to commnunicate with some part of VPC.
      EG. calling an webapi that is hosted over EC2 liying in VPC or accessing an RDS live in VPC.
      Though it is impposible to plave the Lambda in the VPC. 
      But with use of Elastic Network Interface you can actully bridge the lambda with VPC. and give a IP to the labda temporarily.
      How: see lambda.txt.

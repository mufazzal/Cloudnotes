 
Transit VPC:-
  The drawack of VPC-peering is to not to have the transic communication.
  To solve this issue comes a Transit VPC concpt.
  Here you have one central VPC (Hub) and other connected VPC (Spoke).
  The Hub need to have one EC2 running all the time with proper routing software to perform transit.
  This will bear the cost of running EC2.
  
VPN[VPC-to-site]:-
  VPG is used for buinding a VPN netwprk between VPC and ur on-premise infra.
  When you set this up you will be able to use the private IPs of your VPC components and on-premise component in each other.
  for creating VPN connction betwen VPC and site you need below item
  
  At site:-
    1. Customer gateway device: A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection
    2. Create 'Customer gateway' at aws console and attach it to the VPC.
  At AWS
    Ask this two thing from Networks adminstrator of on=premise side
      1. CIDR of ypur on-premise network.
      2. Public IP of your on premise Router
      Now create Virtual private gateway or Transit gateway with this two thing. This will stand at AWS side and reprsent the On-Premise.
  Funally:-
    Map both of the two thing you made and create 'VPN Connection'
    to create it
    1. Select the Customer gateway
    2. select the Virtual private gateway
    3. give full CIDR of complete network
    DONE
  After creation:-
    Once created you can see
    there is two IPSeC channel created fot higher availibilty and each chanel has a Public IP attach to it.
    No via this channel you can communicate between the components of bothe side with their private IP
  
  VPN Charges:-
    You will be charged for 
    1. Till the vpn connection is active, For each hour you will be charged.
    2. First GB of data transfer is free then its chargable.
  
  
    
    
    
    
  
VPN Clodhub:-
  When you have single site-data-center the connecting it with VPC is easy 
  but if you have multiple data center and wants transit communication with each other too the VPN cloudhib is very useful
    
  
Transit Gateway:-
  This help you build your network Topology. As you know VPC can hae many connection like
    VPC peering with 100s of VPC
    Direct Connect with many on-premise
    VPN connection with many on-premise
  The TG will help you to build this with ease
      
   
Direct Connect:-
  The direct connect give you a dadicated fiber connection between ur premise and nearest AWs Hub.
  This is highly costly and you need to work with one of AWs network partner. 
  This give you very low latency fpr connecting to AWS from ur premise. 
  you can connect any AWS public service like S3, DynamoDB or your private network like VPC with direct connect.

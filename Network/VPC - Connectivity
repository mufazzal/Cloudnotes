VPC Peering [VPC-to-VPC]:-
  with VPC peering you can conect two VPC, this VPC can be from diffrent account and region.
  This allow to do the bidirectional connectivity.
  To do this you have to first create the peering connection and then update rout table with proper CIDR of connction VPC.
  This have some limitation
    - both VPC should not have overlapping CIDR
    - VPC peering is point-to-point connectivity, and it does not support transitive routing
    - There is a maximum limit of 125 peering connections per VPC
    - More the connection more the complexity will be
  Charges:
    VPC peering only incurs costs for traffic traveling over the connection (there is no hourly infrastructure fee). 

  VPC Peering VS Endpoint Service:-
    - VPC peering connect two VPC and allow communication from both direction
      EPS is connection between PRovider and Consumer. consumer can consume the exposed sevice of Provider. not vice versa.
    - Any service in both VPC will be exposed to each other by peering
      Only exposed service of provider will be accessible to consumer
    - If you wants to peer two VPC, they must not have overlapping CIDR block.
      CIDR overlapping doesn't matter  
  
Transit VPC:-
  The drawack of VPC-peering is to not to have the transic communication.
  To solve this issue comes a Transit VPC concpt.
  Here you have one central VPC (Hub) and other connected VPC (Spoke).
  The Hub need to have one EC2 running all the time with proper routing software to perform transit.
  This will bear the cost of running EC2.
  
VPN[VPC-to-site]:-
  VPG is used for buinding a VPN netwprk between VPC and ur on-premise infra.
  for creating VPN connction betwen VPC and site you need below item
  At site:-
    Customer gateway device: A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection
  At AWS
    Virtual private gateway or Transit gateway
  Setting them up is not in scope here.

  
VPN Clodhub:-
  When you have single site-data-center the connecting it with VPC is easy 
  but if you have multiple data center and wants transit communication with each other too the VPN cloudhib is very useful
    
  
Transit Gateway:-
  This help you build your network Topology. As you know VPC can hae many connection like
    VPC peering with 100s of VPC
    Direct Connect with many on-premise
    VPN connection with many on-premise
  The TG will help you to build this with ease
      
   
Direct Connect:-
  The direct connect give you a dadicated fiber connection between ur premise and nearest AWs Hub.
  This is highly costly and you need to work with one of AWs network partner. 
  This give you very low latency fpr connecting to AWS from ur premise. 
  you can connect any AWS public service like S3, DynamoDB or your private network like VPC with direct connect.

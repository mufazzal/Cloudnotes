A subnet lies in single AZ only.

Can a two node in VPC (in any same or diffrent subnet) may have same private IP ?
	NO. Bold No. Impossible
	Two subnet can never have a overlapping CIDR block. and each node must has a unique Private IP assosiated with that node. No other can have that again.
	So if any route table look to naviagtion for any private IP then it will have have one and one unique destination for that private IP.
  
For each Subnet there is 5 pre-reserved private IPs by AWS for there inmternal Use:-
  This are
    1. ????????????/
    2.
    3.
    4.
  That is why you always see 5 IP less in available IP colum of the subnet.
  This 5 ips are the first 4 from the start and 1 from the last.
   eg if subnet start from 10.0.3.0 then
   resetved are 
      10.0.3.0, 10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3 and 10.0.0.2555 

Public Subnet:- 
  Any Subnet will become a public subnet if an 'Internet Getway' is attached to it.
  Or more preciecly, a subnet who is attached to routatble which is assosiated with 'Internet Getway'
  By default all the Subnet created are prvate and has no internet getway attached.

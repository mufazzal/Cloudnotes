Security Group:-
  SG is as you know a security wrapper around any component(EC2 or RDS or ENI) which has the capability to reach and rechable to any other newtwork component.
  See EC2 - SG.txt for detail.
  
NACL (Network Access Control List):-
  The NACL is very much like a SG of a Subnet.
  The NACL control what kind of traffic on which port is allowed or denied.
  One Subnet can be attached to only one NACL but one NACL can be assosiated with many subnet.
  The NACL is wrapped aroud the Subnet so that this. NACL now control what type of Traffice can move in and out of that SUBNET.
  If EC2 lies in any subnet then traffic first has to pass out from NACL test and then SG of EC2 will be tested. if both pass then traffice pass through.
  Any trafiic prohibited by NACL will not reach to SG and further network comp at all.
  
  How Rule evaluated:-
    The rule with lower number will evaluate first and keep going till
      - the matching rule come
      - or denied by the last rule *

  Default NACL of VPC:-
    When you craete A VPC it will also create a Default NACL created.
    This NACL simply this two entery in inbound and outbound both
        100   -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
        *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny
    This NACL has all traffic of all type (from internet or inside VPC) open for in and outbound
  
  Cutom NACL:-
    When you create the custom NACL, it it has all the traffic in and out bound denied. 
    Newly created NACL simply has one entery in inbound and outbound both
        *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny
  
  -> The rule with the * cannot be edoted or deleted. 
  -> one subnet can only connect with one NACL. but one NACL can be connected to multiple subnet
  -> It support IPv6. and AWS automatically add the rule for IPv6 block if VPC has IPv6 enabled.  
  
  EGs:-
    Allowing only SSH traffic into the subnets from all over the internet
    Place this in inbound and outboud
        100   -   SSH          -   TCP  -    22   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
        *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny    
    If you give it inly in inound then the packet will reach to instances from internet-client but the response will not be able to reach to the internet-client.
    For any such non-http/https traffic like SSH, RDP etc in and out port are same so inbound and outboud rule are set on same port.
    But for HTTP and  HTTPs its bit tricky
    
    NACL and HTTP Request:-
      Remember one thing: The request Packets comes/go on port 80 and response Packets come/go on Ephameral-ports
      
      Allowing HTTP Originated from internet into the subnet:- For this you have to       
        Inbound: enable inbound on port 80 for HTTP to allow the incoming packet 
          100   -   HTTP         -   TCP  -    80   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
          *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny                
        Outbound: enable outbound on Ephameral ports for HTTP to allow the response to reach to internet 
          100   -   HTTP         -   TCP  -   32768-65535    -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
          *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL            -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny

      Allowing HTTP Originated from Subnet to the internet:- For this you have to       
        Inbound: enable inbound on Ephameral ports for HTTP to allow the response to reach into subnet 
          100   -   HTTP         -   TCP  -   32768-65535    -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW              .........#NACL_RULE_1
          *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL            -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny               .........#NACL_RULE_2
        Outbound: enable Outbound on port 80 for HTTP to allow the outgoing packet from subnet
          100   -   HTTP         -   TCP  -    80   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW                       .........#NACL_RULE_3
          *     -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   Deny                        .........#NACL_RULE_4
      
      Allow to and from for both side:-
        Just merge all the rule.      
      
      NACL and NAT Gateway:-
        NACL for Public Subnet where NAT Gateway lies:-
          This is public subnet so you first have to allow the traffic to and from the subnet and internet. so merge all the rule as discussed above. 
          Now NAT Gateway allow only traffic generated from the inside the Subnet only not the one originated from the Internet. And NAT Gateway uses Ephameral port 1024-65535 
          Now to handle the traffic for NAT Gateway in that subnet for the response of web request just add that in inbound
              Inbound: enable inbound on Ephameral ports for HTTP to allow the response to reach into subnet 
                100   -   HTTP   -   TCP  -   1024-65535     -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
              Outbound: If it is the public subnet the #NACL_RULE_3 will allow traffic for this.
        NACL for Private Subnet where NAT Gateway is attached to:-
          This NACL must 
            - allow the request generated from the private subnet to internet via NAT device 
                Outbound:
                  100   -   HTTP   -   TCP  -    80   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
            - Allows return response from the internet (via NAT device) in the public subnet for requests originating in the private subnet
                Inbound:
                  100   -   HTTP   -   TCP  -    1024-65535   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
                  
            - Allow the request generated from the public subnet to private subnet 
                Inbound:
                 100   -   HTTP   -   TCP  -    PRT   -   CIDR_pub   -   ALLOW     
                 PRT: This could be any port specific to the node like RDS, Aurora(3306), Mysql(3306), Postgress(5432), webserver(3000, 8080, 8085) etc.
                 CIDR_pub: CIDR range of public subnet.
            - Allows return response from the private subnet requests originating in the public subnet
                Outbound:
                  100   -   HTTP   -   TCP  -    32768-65535   -   CIDR_pub   -   ALLOW
                  
            - deny the traffic generated from the internet to private subnet             
          
  NACL VS SG:-
    The SG us statful and NACL is stateless.
    This means that NACL work at packet level and SG work at Request level.

    if a SG has allwoed the request from point A to Point B then the response flow from B to A will automatically granted access.
    But if NACL allwoed the request from point A to Point B then the response flow from B to A can be denied.

    SG do not have any way to specifically deny any source or destination IP but NACL can do this.

    you can deny specific ip via NACL but its not possible with SG.

    By default all traffic is deny by SG, you have to go and allow it.

    The inbound/outbound rule of SG state that who can initiate the request 
      - if he can then the reverse response will be permitted automatically
    The inbound/outbound rule of NACL state that in which direction the packed can flow
      - if he can flow in one direction then still the reverse response can be allowed or denied

---------------

Default SG of VPC:-
  All open to all port
Default NACL of VPC:-
  All open to all port

Newly created SG of VPC:-
  Inbound: None open to None port
  Outbound: All open to all.
Newly created NACL of VPC:-
  Inbound: All Deny
  Outboud: All Deny
  
------------
Max NACL that can be attached to a Subnet = 1
Max SG that can be attached to a EC2 = 5

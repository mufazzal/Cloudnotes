VPC Flow Log:-
  The VPC flow log is mechanism to monitoer the incoming and outgoing PACKET traffic from/to diffrent nodes of VPC

  Depending on renhgularity you wants you can choose the 'ResourceType' in flow log.
    - VPC
    - Subnet
    - ENI
  
  The flow log is part of VPC (not cloudWatch)
  The flow log generate the log stream that can be deliver to CloudWatch or to S3
  
  The log do not track the traffic at request level instead it track the traffic at Packet level which means that unlike typical log where we see entries like
  **** | www.jjj.com |  {..request..} | {..response..} | 200
  we see it like this
  *** | sourceIP | dest IP | srcePort | destPort | packet size | ACCEPT/REJECT |  
  
  For a single request on any VPC node there could be multiple entry if request is large and coming in small packets
  Also there wil be saperate(mutiple possible) entries for response transmission.
  So for a tiny small request there will be at least two entry, one for in and one fro out.
  
  EG:-
    A point 8.8.8.8:89 connect via TCP to 10.9.8.9:22 then u will see at below two entry in flow log
    
    2 |  8.8.8.8 | 10.9.8.9 | 89 | 22 | 6 | <no of packets> | ACCEPT
    2 | 10.9.8.9 |  8.8.8.8 | 22 | 89 | 6 | <no of packets> | ACCEPT
    -> The first entry is for request coming in and other is for response going out.

  With the flow log you can analyze the the packet level traffic. you cannot see what inside the packet. 
  so you cannot analyze the typical requetselement like header, body, methode, statuscode etc.. but you can analyze communication nodes.

  You can also set if you wants log of ACCEPT or REJECT or ALL traffic via 'TrafficType' 
  

  The below CFL will create a Flow Log and deliver the Log to CloudWatch Log Group:-
      MyFlowLog:
        Type: AWS::EC2::FlowLog
        Properties: 
          DeliverLogsPermissionArn: <LogDeliveryRoleArn>
          LogDestinationType: "cloud-watch-logs"
          LogGroupName: "MyLogGroup"
          ResourceId: <id of vpc or subnet or ENI>
          ResourceType: "VPC or Subnet or ENI"
          TrafficType: "ACCEPT or REJECT or ALL"      
          LogFormate: '<formate string>'

  DeliverLogsPermissionArn:-
    This is the IAM role that you have create. This IAM role will be assumed by the Flow-log service.
    and this role will permitte hime to create amnd write the log group and log in cloudwatch.
    this look like beloe:-
          LogDeliveryRole:
                ...
                AssumeRolePolicyDocument: !Sub |
                  {...
                    "Statement": [{ 
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Principal": { "Service": "vpc-flow-logs.amazonaws.com" },
                        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
                     }]
                  }           
                  .....
                    PolicyDocument: !Sub |
                      {...
                        "Statement": [{
                            "Action": [ "logs:CreateLogGroup", "logs:CreateLogStream", "logs:PutLogEvents", "logs:DescribeLogGroups", "logs:DescribeLogStreams" ],
                            "Effect": "Allow",
                            "Resource": "*"
                         }]
                      }           
    
    
    If you wants to deliver the log to S3 bucket then:
          MainVPCFlowLog:
              Type: AWS::EC2::FlowLog
              Properties: 
                ResourceId: !Ref VPCID
                ResourceType: VPC
                TrafficType: ACCEPT
                LogDestination: !GetAtt S3BucketMainVPCLog.Arn
                LogDestinationType: s3    
    The bucket must have a bucket policy with below alloed principle
       "Principal": { "Service": "delivery.logs.amazonaws.com" }

  LogFormate: 
    This string you can use to cutomize the strucure of log 
    How?

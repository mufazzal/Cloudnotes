VPG is used for buinding a VPN netwprk between VPC and ur on-premise infra.
When you set this up you will be able to use the private IPs of your VPC components and on-premise component in each other.
for creating VPN connction betwen VPC and site you need below item

At site:-
  1. Customer gateway device: A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection
  2. Create 'Customer gateway' at aws console and attach it to the VPC.
At AWS
  Ask this two thing from Networks adminstrator of on=premise side
    1. CIDR of your on-premise network.
    2. Public IP of your on premise Router
    Now create Virtual private gateway or Transit gateway with this two thing. This will stand at AWS side and reprsent the On-Premise.
Funally:-
  Map both of the two thing you made and create 'VPN Connection'
  to create it
  1. Select the Customer gateway
  2. select the Virtual private gateway
  3. give full CIDR of complete network
  DONE  
    
    vpg1 = f(CIDR of CD1, Public IP of router of CD1)
    vpg2 = f(CIDR of CD2, Public IP of router of CD2)

After creation:-
  Once created you can see
  there is two IPSeC channel created fot higher availibilty and each chanel has a Public IP attach to it.
  No via this channel you can communicate between the components of bothe side with their private IP

VPN Charges:-
  You will be charged for 
  1. Till the vpn connection is active, For each hour you will be charged.
  2. First GB of data transfer is free then its chargable.

Accelerated VPN connection:-
  You can enable this featre. This ses the AWs Global accelerator to rote the traffic via edge location to AWS via AWS backbone network.
  You have to use Transit Gateway for this. VPG do not support it.
 
 
Transit Gateway:-
	Trsansit gateway can be used in place of Virtual Private Gateway in AWS side.
	This give you better option to connect the VPC with other element like peering, direct connect and multiple VPN connection.
	TG also can be used to communicate between the sites.

Think of NACL like a SG of subnet. The NACL is wrapped aroud the Subnet so that thisNACL now control what type of Traffice can move in and out of that SUBNET.

When you craete A VPC it will also create a Default NACL created.
  This NACL simply has one entery
    100   -   ALL Traffic  -   ALL  -   ALL   -   0.0.0.0/0   -   ALLOW
  This NACL has all traffic of all type (from internet or inside VPC) open for in and outbound



one subnet can only connect with one NACL
but one NACL can be connected to multiple subnet
So its relation is like below
                                Subnet 1      
        NACL 1---------------   Subnet 2
                                Subnet 3  

But not like
    
        NACL 1------------
        NACL 2------------  Subnet 1
        NACL 3------------

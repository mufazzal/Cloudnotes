Cost Minimization
  - Data transferred between Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache instances, and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same Availability Zone is free
  - Data transfer between EC2 and S3 bucket in same region is free.
  
  EFS VS EBS VS S3:-
    EBS: Charged for provisioned storage. HIGHEST COST. becoz you may have to pay for allocated but unused space
    EFS: Charged based on current allocated storage size. LOWER COST. Only pay for used space
    S3:  Charged based on current allocated storage size. LOWEST COST. Only pay for used space but cost less then EFS

FSX Window VS S3 File Gateway:- 
  FSX window is fully managed Window Server which can be used with On-Premise Data storage or AWS Backed Storage (SSD).
  The storage here is not S3 but some SSD drive at aws or in on premise.
S3 File Gateway:-
  This is the service that gives you File-based SMB interface to access the Onbecj-baseed S3 files storage.
  Here YOu do not have the full blown window file server but you do have 
  - A way to access the file via SMB client 
  - A way to perform operation with S3 API and all feature od S3.

Disaster Recovery Mechanichs:-
  1. Pilot Light:- In this system a trim down version of whole applcatioin with minimal enviorment set up run.
        It keep running the critical component as well as copying the critical data for restore. 
        You do ignore the non critical component.
        In case of Distaster you can keep runing the critical part and bring up whole systen later.
 2.  Warm Stadby:- Here an scale down version of whole application keep running. Its costly the Pilot Light but give less RTO and RPO.
 3.  Multi Site:- It has Active-Active failover system. where App is running at both end. Data replication methode you use will define the RTO and RPO.
 4.  Backup and Restore: A typical Tape based back up on cheap storage and restore it whne needed. It can have the loss of data based on defined RPO.

Cost Minimization
  - Data transferred between Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache instances, and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same Availability Zone is free
  - Data transfer between EC2 and S3 bucket in same region is free.
  
  EFS VS EBS VS S3:-
    EBS: Charged for provisioned storage. HIGHEST COST. becoz you may have to pay for allocated but unused space
    EFS: Charged based on current allocated storage size. LOWER COST. Only pay for used space
    S3:  Charged based on current allocated storage size. LOWEST COST. Only pay for used space but cost less then EFS

FSX Window VS S3 File Gateway:- 
  FSX window is fully managed Window Server which can be used with On-Premise Data storage or AWS Backed Storage (SSD).
  The storage here is not S3 but some SSD drive at aws or in on premise.
  Support SMB
S3 File Gateway:-
  This is the service that gives you File-based SMB as well as NFS interface to access the Onbecj-baseed S3 files storage.
  Here YOu do not have the full blown window file server but you do have 
  - A way to access the file via SMB/NFS client 
  - A way to perform operation with S3 API and all feature od S3.

 3. Multi Site:-  Active-Active failover system. No Start and No scalling required.
 1. Warm Stadby:- Scaled down, but fully functional, copy of your production environment in another Region. No Start and But scalling required. 
 2. Pilot Light:- Simillar to Warm standby but need to take action to start it. Start and both scalling required
 4. Backup and Restore: A typical Tape based back up on cheap storage and restore it whne needed. It can have the loss of data based on defined RPO.

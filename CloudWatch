This is monitering PERFORMANCE in services for all your AWS resources and Application
It can monitor EC2, S3, Auto scalling  Group, ELB, Route53, EBSs, Storage getway ETC.

Amazon CloudWatch monitors your Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. 
You can use CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, which are variables you can measure for your resources and applications.

With this data in CW you can
  - Create the Custom dashboard for monitering
  - get statistics grapf for system performance
  - Create alarm and notification for specific CW event
  

Concept:- 
  To understand the CW you must know nelow terminology
  
  NameSpace:-
    This is the top level sagregation of monitering data. The data are partitioned in this name space are isolated from eachother
    AWS has unique CW Namespace for each AWS Service
    EG:
      EC2: AWS/EC2
      S3: AWS/S3
      Lambda: AWS/LAmbda.
  
  Metrics:-
    Metrics are the Monitering values that are in the form of Time Ordered Data-Point. 
    Each Data point is the state of monitering values in that moment of time.
    For each AWS resource typethere many Metrics are available to track. Some of them are free and some are paid.
    
    Time Stamps:
      Each data point in the metrics contain the timestamp that reprsent the time when sate of monitering values are captured. 
    Metrics Resolution:
      The data metrics can have the two resolution
        Standard[By Default]: data point are taken ini one minute granularity
        High resolution:      data point are taken ini one second granularity
    Metrics Retention:-
      There is no way to delete the data metrics manually. instead this metrics are stayed for specific prode of time and then deleted automatically.
      - For data with priode < 1 minute its 3 hour [High resolution]
      - For data with priode = 1 minute its 15 days
      - For data with priode < 5 minute its 63 days
      - For data with priode < 60 minute its 455 days
    
  Dimension:-
    A dimension is a name/value pair that is part of the identity of a metric. You can assign up to 10 dimensions to a metric.
    Every metric has specific characteristics that describe it, and you can think of dimensions as categories for those characteristics. 
    For each AWS resource there are certain charachtristic which are reprsented in CW by the dimention
    
  Metrics VS Dimention:-
    Metric is the param to be moniter
    Dimension is the way to filtering and indexing those Metrics.

    Metrcis data keep on generating till AWS resource is there.
    Dimesion is the chrachtristic, assosiated at the time of that AWS resource created/Updated.
    
  
AWS Service - NameSpace <> Metrics <> Dimensions. 
 Below is the example of some IMP data metrics in CW-
  
  EC2:-
    Namespace: AWS/Ec2
    Metrics:-
      CPUUtilization, DiskReadOps, DiskWriteOps, NetworkIn, NetworkOut, CPUCreditUsage, StatusCheckFailed	 
    Dimensions:-
      InstanceId, AutoScalingGroupName, ImageId, InstanceType
    
  S3:-
    Namespace: AWS/S3
    Metrics:-
      BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects, AllRequests, GetRequests, OperationsPendingReplication
    Dimensions:-
      BucketName, StorageType
    
  Lambda:-
    Namespace: AWS/Lambda
    Metrics:-
      Invocations, Errors, ProvisionedConcurrencyInvocations, Duration  
    Dimensions:-
      FunctionName, ExecutedVersion

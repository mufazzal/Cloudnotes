Service Role:-
  Many AWS service can perform certain operation on other service like an 
    EC2 can put/post an image in S3, 
    the codedeploy can attach/dettach/terminate the instances,
    Lambda function can write logs in cloudwatch
    etc.
    
    If one servoce need to perform certain operation on other service then the called servoce must have permission to perform that operation on Calle service.
    This permission is given by the Service-Roles.
    The service role is inherently design for the specific services so that it can do operation on certain other services

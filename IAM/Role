Role:-
  Many AWS service can perform certain operation on other service like an 
    EC2 can put/post an image in S3, 
    the codedeploy can attach/dettach/terminate the instances,
    Lambda function can write logs in cloudwatch
    etc.
    
    If one service need to perform certain operation on other service then the called service must have permission to perform that operation on Calle service.
    This permission is given by the Roles.
    The Role is inherently design for the specific services so that it can do operation on certain other services
    
Now the role document tells you two main thing
  1. Who can assume that role. ie which AWS services like S3, CFT, EC2 can asume that role.
  2. What resources and action the candidate aws service can access.

Role:-
  Many AWS service can perform certain operation on other service like an 
    EC2 can put/post an image in S3, 
    the codedeploy can attach/dettach/terminate the instances,
    Lambda function can write logs in cloudwatch
    etc.
    
    If one service need to perform certain operation on other service then the called service must have permission to perform that operation on Calle service.
    This permission is given by the Roles.
    The Role is inherently design for the specific services so that it can do operation on certain other services
    
Now the role document tells you two main thing
  1. Who can assume that role. ie which AWS services like S3, CFT, EC2 can asume that role.
  2. What resources and action the candidate aws service can access.
  
  The first one is decied by Trust-Policy, every Role has the trust policy document whose formate is like below:-
    {
      "Statement": [{
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
        }]
    }  
  By this we state that this role can be assumed by EC2s.
  
  The second one is decided bt typical IAM policy statement.
  
  To create Role by Cloudformation:-
        Resources:
          EC2WebServerIAMRole:
            Type: 'AWS::IAM::Role'
            Properties:
              AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
                Version: 2012-10-17
                Statement:
                  - Effect: Allow
                    Principal:
                      Service:
                      - ec2.amazonaws.com
                    Action:
                      - 'sts:AssumeRole'
              Path: /
              Policies:
                - PolicyName: EC2WebServerIAMRolePolicy
                  PolicyDocument:
                    Version: 2012-10-17
                    Statement:
                      - Effect: Allow
                        Action: '*'
                        Resource: '*'  
                        
                        
  InstanceProfile:-
    This is a very special case. When a role is created for EC2 then with the role there is instance profile is also created.
    AWS CLI and CFR use the instance profile ARN(not Role ARN) for assigning the role to EC2.

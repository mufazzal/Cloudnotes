IF you wants to make any operation on the AWS resource then you must need a IAM USer or Role to do it.
SO you will have to create one.

But STS provide you way to do operation on the AWS resource via User of some Active Directory (not IAM user or Role) 
without needing to create a corrosponding AWS IAM User or Role for them.

STS provide you the temporary AWS IAM credential with Access Key + ID + Session token to perform operation over AWS resources.
This token are short lived and generated for specific Federated user.

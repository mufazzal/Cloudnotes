IF you wants to make any operation on the AWS resource then you must need a IAM USer or Role to do it.
SO you will have to create one.

But STS provide you way to do operation on the AWS resource via User of some Active Directory (not IAM user or Role) 
without needing to create a corrosponding AWS IAM User or Role for them.

STS provide you the temporary AWS IAM credential with Access Key + ID + Session token to perform operation over AWS resources.
This token are short lived and generated for specific Federated user.

VIMP: To generate Faderated temprary cred you need a IAM user not role.


Below is the list of STS api that can be used to generate the Temporarry Security Cres for diifrent kind of user

  1. AssumeRole:                  IAM user or IAM role with existing temporary security credentials
  2. AssumeRoleWithSAML:          Any User with passed SAML response. like ADFS user
  3. AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity:   Any User with passed web base identity like Google, FB, Apple Id, AWS Cognito, OpenID connect
  4. GetFederationToken:          IAM user or AWS account root user
  5. GetSessionToken:             IAM user or AWS account root user
  
  In all above api you have input: 
    Policy, PolicyArn, A param for token of that user.
  In response you have
    AccessKey, Id and session token

---
  STS:AssumeRole is note cumlative, mns that if you assume this role then you giveup your previous role. and as soon as this role is release from you
  the previous role is re-applied to you.

The IAM is of course a core of any system.
This give u a way to create and authorize the user for ceertain user

IAM is region independent, it means that if you create and nay user/group in the account then ir will be available to all 
region, not specific to the one you may have selected.

Root Account: This is the most parent account, basucally the owner one. like h.mufazzal@gmail.com in my case.
This account/user neither can be deleted nor modified for less permission. This user have all the permissions.

In the IAM module you create the user and its group. 

In the company generally we create group like Admin, HR, Developer, Manageer etc. 
This group will have specific set of permissions to perform operation on aws console.

In IAM you should know the tuening between following things to uderstand it completely 
(For now lets go in drief)
  1.  User: An entity that will access the aws console/cli and perform operation on it.
  2.  Policies: A set of permissions that are clubbed together for creating a profile.
  3.  Role: ??????????????????
  4.  Group: A group has a number of policy assign to it. and all the user in this group will have those policy assigned to them 
              automatucally.
              
              
 Lets see User-Policies-Group tuening -
 
 You have many people in team lets box them all in proper place
 
 You have - 
  Mufazzal, Abhishek, 
  Anand, Dhaval
  Abhijit, Jigitha, 
  Ravi, poorty, Sourabh, pavvan
  
  For Developer -> 
  
  First idetify the accessablity of those guys, whart kind of operation they can do and so enlist the policies for them
  E.G. A developer should have policies like 
  AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess etc. 
  
  Then create the group "Developers", This group will have all the policies we enlisted above. 
  
  So Group-Developer will have [AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess] policies.
  
      Group = f(policies) and C(User) >> Group is a function of policies and collecion of users.
  Finally Create user and assign them in group.
  
   
   Policies:-
   In whole IAM this one is a most complcated or pain in a ***. Lets en in it 
   Can user UUUUU perform the operation OOOO on the resource RRRRR
   This is described in the form of JSON and u must master its interpetation
    
    So in very very generic form it goes like this ->
    
    User UUUU have policy PPP
    PPP =
      ...
      Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": Allow/Deny, L1
                "Action": OOOO,       L2
                "Resource" RRRR:      L3
            }, {...}, {...}
         ] 
    ...
    
    L1: tell you should he be able to do it or not
    L2: List of action(add, edit, delete) we are talking about. Mostly its a array.
    L3: List of resources (EC2, S3, Codedeploy) we are talking about.
    
    
    

   The Policy is the most fundamental document, it define that 
   user UUUU has permisiion DENY/ALLOW to perform operation OOO on Resource RRR
   You can write as many policy you wants, but there many such policy are already provideed by AWS already.
   
   The groups are the template which are made of policies. you can add as many policy you wants in the group.
   Now all the user who are liing in this group will have those policy attached to them.
   
   
   Can i assign policy directly to user ->
    yes.
    
    
   Role:-
    Just like group, the Role is also a template which are made of policies. you can add as many policy you wants in the Role.
    Role is quite a diffrent kind of entity. Role is not at all useful for the normal user you created in the same aws account.
    the role are assign to following items
    1. An user from diffrent AWS account
    2. EC2 and Lembda
    3. Identity fedration user.

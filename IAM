The IAM is of course a core of any system.
This give u a way to create and authorize the user for ceertain user

IAM is region independent, it means that if you create and nay user/group in the account then ir will be available to all 
region, not specific to the one you may have selected.

Root Account: This is the most parent account, basucally the owner one. like h.mufazzal@gmail.com in my case.
This account/user neither can be deleted nor modified for less permission. This user have all the permissions.

In the IAM module you create the user and its group. 

In the company generally we create group like Admin, HR, Developer, Manageer etc. 
This group will have specific set of permissions to perform operation on aws console.

In IAM you should know the tuening between following things to uderstand it completely 
(For now lets go in drief)
  1.  User: An entity that will access the aws console/cli and perform operation on it.
  2.  Policies: A set of permissions that are clubbed together for creating a profile.
  3.  Role: ??????????????????
  4.  Group: A group has a number of policy assign to it. and all the user in this group will have those policy assigned to them 
              automatucally.
              
              
 Lets see User-Policies-Group tuening -
 
 You have many people in team lets box them all in proper place
 
 You have - 
  Mufazzal, Abhishek, 
  Anand, Dhaval
  Abhijit, Jigitha, 
  Ravi, poorty, Sourabh, pavvan
  
  For Developer -> 
  
  First idetify the accessablity of those guys, whart kind of operation they can do and so enlist the policies for them
  E.G. A developer should have policies like 
  AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess etc. 
  
  Then create the group "Developers", This group will have all the policies we enlisted above. 
  
  So Group-Developer will have [AWSCodeBuildDeveloperAccess, AWSCodeDeployFullAccess] policies.
  
      Group = f(policies) and C(User) >> Group is a function of policies and collecion of users.
  Finally Create user and assign them in group.

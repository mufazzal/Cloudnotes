There are diffrent technique you can adopt for performance optimization for diffrent kind of operation.

Transfer Acceleration:-
          Target:-
            Latency minimization
          What it Optimize:-
            GET and PUT
          How
            Instead of simple internet, it uses Amazon backbon network

CloudFront + S3:-
          Target:-
            Latency minimization
          What it Optimize:-
            GET
          How
            By caching the content in nearest edge location. and us Amazon backbon network to get object if no cache there.
    
Multipart Upload:-
          Target:-
            Throughput / maximise bandwith usage
          What it Optimize:-
            PUT
          How
            By breaking large file in small parts and upload then in paraller. remerge them in the end of operation.
    
Range Based Get:-
          Target:-
            Throughput / maximise bandwith usage
          What it Optimize:-
            GET
          How
            By breaking large file in small parts and download them in paraller. remerge them in the end of operation.

Secondery Indexes:-
          Target:-
            faster response by s3
          What it Optimize:-

S3 Inventory:-
          Target:-

There are diffrent technique you can adopt for performance optimization for diffrent kind of operation.

:-
Technique                 Target                                    Operation            How               
Transfer Acceleration     Latency minimization                      GET and PUT          Instead of simple internet, it uses Amazon backbon network                                                       
CloudFront + S3           Latency minimization                      GET                  By caching the content in nearest edge location. and us Amazon backbon network to get object if no cache there.
Multipart Upload          Throughput / maximise bandwith usage      PUT                  By breaking large file in small parts and upload then in paraller. remerge them in the end of operation.
Range Based Get           Throughput / maximise bandwith usage      GET                  By breaking large file in small parts and download them in paraller. remerge them in the end of operation.

Versioning and Replica both are applied over the Buket Level not on Object level.

Versioning:-
  The bucket can be in two state at a time either at Versioning Enabled or at Versioning Suspended.
  By default it is versioning Suspended state.
  
  By enabling it you can preserve the object previos versions after deletion or override.
  
  Say you created a bucket 'ProfilePic' and upload three pic.
  This look like below
  	
  | muf.jpg 	null	3MB |		#state0
  | arr.jpg 	null	2MB |
  | mur.jpg 	null	1MB |
  -----------------------
  
  Deleting/Override/upload for version suspended bucket:-
    This will Delete/Override/upload the object without retaining any trace of that object.
    EG. 
			you do
			DELETE muf.jpg
			PUT arr.jpg 
			PUT hus.jpg
			
	| 									  |
	| hus.jpg 	null	2MB |
	| arr.jpg 	null	9MB |
	| mur.jpg 	null	1MB |
	-----------------------
	
Enable versioning in version suspended Bucket:-	
	If you enable the versioning after some of the nonversioned object uploaded there then those object will remain unversioned
	they will not be preserve with version id if somone upload or delete them.
	So bucket may look like below if you enable versioning on #state0
	
  | muf.jpg 	null	3MB |
  | arr.jpg 	null	2MB |
  | mur.jpg 	null	1MB |
  -----------------------	
	
Upload/Override on Version enabled Bucket:-
	If you upload any objevt in version enable bucket then S3 will add then object in bucket and assign a version id to him.
	Whart happed to pervios versions of that object is depend on below 
		1. If object does not exist previously
		2. If object exist previously and its vId = null.
		3. If object exist previously and its vId not null.
		
		1, 2 and 3: In all the cases the new object will be uploaded and no trace of previous one will be retain(for overide)
		So bucket will look like below. EG (muf.jpg overried and hus.jpg fresh upload)
		
			| muf.jpg 	v1		5MB	<|>	muf.jpg 	null	3MB |
			| hus.jpg 	v1		7MB 												|
			| arr.jpg 	null	2MB 												|
			| mur.jpg 	null	1MB 												|
			-----------------------------------------------		
		
			say after uploading v1 of 'muf.jpg' you again upload it.
		
			| muf.jpg 	v2		5MB	<|>	muf.jpg 	v1	3MB	<|>	muf.jpg		null	3MB |			#state1
			| hus.jpg 	v1		7MB 																							|
			| arr.jpg 	null	2MB 																							|
			| mur.jpg 	null	1MB 																							|
			---------------------------------------------------------------------
			
			At this state if you do
			GET muf.jpg the you will get muf.jpg@v2

		
Delete on Version enabled Bucket:-
	If you Delete any objevt in version enable bucket then S3 will not actully delete that OBject Key instead S3 will add 
	a Delete Marker (DM) on the top of that object-key with latest version id and make it apear like delete.
	Whart happed to pervios versions of that object is depend on below 
		1. If object does not exist previously
		2. If object exist previously and its vId = null.
		3. If object exist previously and its vId not null. 			
		
		Suppose bucket at #state1 you did two operation
		DELETE muf.jpg and
		DELETE hus.jpg
		
			| #DM#			v3		 -	<|>	muf.jpg		v2	5MB	<|>	muf.jpg 	v1	3MB	<|>	muf.jpg		null	3MB |			
			| #DM#		 	v2		 -  <|>	hus.jpg 	v1	7MB																								|
			| arr.jpg 	null	2MB 																						                        |
			| mur.jpg 	null	1MB 																							                      |
			-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	

			At this state if you do
				GET muf.jpg the you will get 404

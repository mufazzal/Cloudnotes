There is two state where you have to preserve the integrity of your data
  1. Data at rest:    
        Mns when data is stored in the disk. and so no one with physical access of disk can read it. 
        Data is Encrypted before writing and decrypted before reading.
  2. Data in transit: MIM attack
      
En/Dc mechanism provide by AWS:-      
  1.  Server Side Encryption:
      Here the en/dc take place at server side.
      It give defence at 'Data at rest' but not in 'Data at transit'
        - Each object is encrypted with unique Data Key 
        - Data keys are encrypted with the Master Key

      Its of 3 type:
        1.1 SSE-S3: Encryption with S3 managed key
                      Here En/Dc is done by S3 itself
                      You do not have any control over key. No maintainance of key required by you. S3 do it for you
                        - Master key rotated automatically and S3 do it for you
                        - The master key ise here is belongs to S3 not of KMS. KMS do not come to picture at all.
                        - It free to use
                        - Just enable it and use. 
                        - This is chargable
        1.2 SSE-KMS: Encryption with KMS managed key
                      Here En/Dc is done by S3 itself
                      maintainance of key is done in KMS either by KMS himself or by user.
             1.2.1: 
                  You can use AWS generated Customer Master Key [on behalf of S3] that is asw/s3
                        - AWS KMS generate the master key for that service(S3) once. and next time use that only master key for any en/dc operation for that service 
             1.2.2:
                  You can create your own Customer Master Key in KMS and use it.
                        - user manage key enabling and rotation
        1.3 SSE-C: Encryption with Customer managed key
                        - In this mechanism the user provide the key at tome of uploading the object. S3 use this key for encryption and then delete it.
                            Now at the time of GET user again as to provide this ket so that S3 will now decrypt the data and give it back to you.
                            So S3 not ata all store key anywhere. Customer is responsible for key handling totally.
                            It works only with HTTPS.

  2. CLient Side Encryption: In the client side encryption you do the encrytion at your end only. S3 do not do en/dc at all.
        It give defence at 'Data at rest' and 'Data at transit' both.
        Now how you mange key at your client end is your choice. but s3 juse store the encrypted data you asked him to store.  
        Now based on how you manage the key there is two choice:
          1.2.1: Key managed by customer: you have tour own infra to manage the keys
          1.2.1: Key managed by KMS: You use KMS instead of you own key management syatem
  
  3. Enforce HTTPS:-
      You can use Bucket Policy to restrict user to use HTTPS and not HTTP.
      It give defence at 'Data at transit' but not in 'Data at rest'   
      
Mechanism of Server Side Enc - SSE-S3 :-
  This is how the flow look like
  - User make a request with PUT {file, =SSE-S3}
  - S3 will now generate the data key
  - S3 will now encrypt file with data key
  - S3 will now encrypt data ley with master key of S3.
  - S3 wil now store encrypted file + encrypted data key
    IMP: file is encrypted wilth Data Key and Data Key is encrypted with S3-Master-Key

Encryption over entire bucket:- 
    Actully there is no way to set up somthing like 'encrypt all the file with this key'
    also there is no straight forward way to set up somthing like 'encrypt each uploading file with this key'
    
    Encryption occure only over the objevt not on bucket itself.
    
    But thate is couple of tricks in BP, through wich you can configure the bucket behavior wrt encryption of its contents.
    
    How we do it?
    Simply in BP you must place some restriction/conditions as such that bkt will accept only if those condition got fullfiled.
    
    Now what are the tools to use for this condition?
    You know if you upload a file, what api is actully being used/called 
    that is PutObject.
    Now if you wants it to be uploded with eencryption then what headre u must provide
    that is 'x-amz-server-side-encryption'
    So thats your first and formost tool
    you may/may not also use the key-ir param if u sed 'aws:kms'
    so 'x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id' is your another tool.
    
    There are some more header params available but this 2 are most imp.
    
    Now with this you can write the bucket policy for any bkt, this policy can set a rule that what should be the values of those or
    who among them are required or not.
    Simply we write BP that will check that the uploaded-object-request (PutObject) do have the the proper values of inlined headers or not     
 
      
    EG:
    LEts say you wants to make sure that anything uploaded in bkt is Encrypted :-
    So u write BP as
    {
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mufencryptedeucket/*",
            "Condition": {
                "Null": {
                    "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "false"                    
                    }
                }
            }
        ]
    }    
    
    Observe here waht it say:-
    Deny all the user("Principal": "*") to upload the file (upload use PutObject api) in bkt 'mufencryptedeucket' if the statement in the condition is true.
    Now what is the condition: The condition check if header "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption" is prsent or not
    if not present then condition satisfied and you are denied the access.
    if present then then condition de-satisfied and you are not denied the access so allowed.
    
    So this BP simply make sure that anything uploaded in bkt is encrypted. It does not matter that you user key source 'aws:kms' or 'AES-256'
    It also does not matter what key you user for encryption.
    
    
    Now you are still not happy and you wants more so you wants that it should be encrypted and only encrypted with 'aws:kms'
    For this you simply change the codtionlike this
    
     "Condition": {
              "StringNotEquals": {
                     "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms"
                  }
            } 
    Now it will make sure that upcoming thisngs are encrypted and encrypted with 'aws:kms'
    
    Still wants more:-
    say you wants that it should be encryped with 'aws:kms' and key used in the encryption is also be always 'mufkey'
    Then
    
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mufencryptedeucket/*",
            "Condition": {"StringNotEquals": { "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms" }}
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Deny",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:PutObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mufencryptedeucket/*",
            "Condition": { "StringNotEquals": "s3:x-amz-server-side-encryption-aws-kms-key-id": "arn:aws:kms:ap-south-1:388412347424:key/<mufKeyId>"}}
        }
    ]
}    
      
      
     Conjecture of Key-Policy and BP :-
        When you are doing encrytion/decryption on any S3 object then there is two policy come inti pucture. 
        BP: The policy that is attached to bkt
        KP: The key policy that define which user can access the the key for certaion operration like encrypt/decrypt
        
        The user(Principle) who is doing the operation MUST MUST have permission to
        perform that operation (decrypt fro GetObject and encrypt for PutObject). So KP and BP must be written with harmony.

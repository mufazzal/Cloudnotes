Lifecycle is one of the most imp thing you set for saving cost.

It enable you to transit and delete the object in its lifetime. 

To anable it go to 
  S3 > you bucket > MAnagement > Lifrcycle > Add Rule
  
  Below are thing that you can configure for lifecycle
  1. Scope: 
    - You can apply the rule to whole bucket or 
    - You can choose prefix or Tag to filter the object on which this rule is applied.
  2. Transition Rule
      This define that after how many days the object can travel from one storage class to other.
      There are couple of criterion for this rule statement. see #TransitionCriterion 
      You can choose if you wants apply this rule to currunt or all versions of objects.
      So you input three things here
        - apply on current, previous
        - array of transion rule
            - the storage class
            - Days.
   3. Expiration Rule
        Here you give after how many days you wants to delete the object.
        So you input three things here
          - apply on current, previous
          - No of days.      
      
#TransitionCriterion:
  The movement of objct from certain storage to other storage class has some prohibition. All combination are not possible
  below is the list
    - 'Standard' class object can be transit to any other class
    - 'Inteligent Tiering' class object cannot transit to 'Standard' but can transit to all other.
    - 'Onezone_IA' can move to 'Glacier' and 'Deep_Archive' but can not move to 'Standard' and 'Inteligent Tiering'
    - You can not move 'Glacier' and 'Deep_Archive' class object to any other class.
    - You cannot make lifecycle rule for MFA enaled bucket
  There is some rule for size and days if you are transitioning from Standarrd or Standard-IA to Standard-IA or One-zone-IAA or Inteligent tiering 
    - Object must lie at least 30 days before it can make any transition.
    - Minimum size of the object to transit ahould be larger then 128kb for cost effectivness
 
 
 Object flow always to the botton-right:-
  S3-Standard
    S3-Standard-IA
      S3-IT
        S3-One-zone-IA
          Glacier
            Glacier-Deep
 
Behaviour of Expiration Rule on unversioned/version-enable/version-suspended bucket on the CURRENT Object:-
  Expiration on unversioned:-
    Simply delete the object
  Expiration on version-enable:
    Do not delete rather place the Delete Marker on the top of that object key
  Expiration on version-suspended
    - if versionId = null then delete the object 
    - if versionId != null then do not delete the object rather place the Delete Marker on the top. 
    
  If object has delete mark at top
      Simply delete the DM and objects below it 

Behaviour of Expiration Rule on unversioned/version-enable/version-suspended bucket on the PREVIOUS Object:-
  SImply delete it.
  
Behaviour of Transition Rule on Delete Marker:-
  Nothing! because transition rule move the object from one storage class to other. The DM do not lie in any class. Its just an indicator of deletion not real file.
  

So in version enabled bucket the current object first become the prevoius object and then finally this previous object is deleted.

--------------------

Lifecycle rule for deleting incomplete multipart upload:-
  You can use Lifecycle rule for deletinf files which take too long time to upload or do not upload fully via multippart.
  You just have to provide maximum days a file can take to finish the multipart upload. after that it deleted automatically by lifcycle policy.
  EG:-
    aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle-configuration  --bucket bucketname  --lifecycle-configuration lfc.cfg 
    lfc.cfg:-
        {"Rules": [{ "ID": "Test Rule",
                  "Status": "Enabled",
                  "AbortIncompleteMultipartUpload": { "DaysAfterInitiation": 7 }
         }]}
    
------------------


Say you put below lifecycle policy via CLF:-
        LifecycleConfiguration:
            Rules:
              - Id: DeleteContentAfter1Day
                Status: 'Enabled'
              # Prefix: "private/"
                Transition:
                  StorageClass: "GLACIER"
                  TransitionInDays: 1                   #RULE1    
                ExpirationInDays: 2                     #RULE2
                NoncurrentVersionTransition: 
                  StorageClass: "GLACIER"          
                  TransitionInDays: 1                   #RULE3 
                NoncurrentVersionExpirationInDays: 2    #RULE4

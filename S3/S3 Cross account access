There is 3 diffrent way to give access of your Bucket/Object to diffrent AWS account.
The approch you take depends on what level of access you wants to give to the user of other AWS account.

Suppose there is a account Muf who own the bucket mufBkt, and another account Mur wants its access

Those are
  1. By ACL(in Muf) and IAM(in Mur):
      This will gives you very basic PROGRAMATIC access. at best Mur can see the list of object in bucket and download/read the objects
      Muf have to set the ACL of Bucket properly and Mur have to provide its respective IAM user proper IAM permission to do operation on S3.
    
 2. By BP(in Muf) and IAM(in Mur):
    This will gives advance PROGRAMATIC access. by this you can read/edit/delete/creatTag/deleteTag etc on the bucket and object.
    Muf have to set the BP of Bucket properly and Mur have to provide its respective IAM user proper IAM permission to do operation on S3.
    --> By default BP deny any operation by other AWS account. you have to explicitly allow it for forigen aws account.
    
 3. Cross Account IAM Role:
    This will give you console access and Programatic access both(unlike above two who give programatic access)
    For this Muf has to create a IAM Role for Other AWS Account which will have permission to do operation on S3 only.
    
    Now other aws account can assume this role and see theaccesible bucket and object in it.

In very Simple word S3 (Simple Storage Service) is STATIC STORAGE. 
A bucket that is best place to put static HTML, css, video, image, static JS  etc.

Things that should be stored in S3 :-
  Any kind of flat file like image, .html. video etc
Wich should not:-
  Any dynamic/processable/database/OS file
  
 
Bucket:-
  In very simple word, This is a kind of UNIQUE folder in the ENTIRE S3 UNIVERSE
  So when you create it, its name must be quique (not relative to the buckets in your S3 account but in an entire S3 unviverse)
  So you can not take name like test, test123 etc as they may have taken centuries ago. 

Region of S3:-
  S3 is region independent, when you open S3 in aws console you will see region selected as 'Global' and other rigion remian unselectable.
  It means that S3 service remain same in entire aws system.
  If "Test" bucket in created in region "Asia" then "Test" cant be created again by anyone in any region ever.
Region of bucket:
  Though S3 is region independent, but the bucket created in S3 by you will must lie in a selected region 
  
Q:  Can i access the bucket on region A in Region B
  ????????
 

How To create Bucket :-
  1. aws > S3 > Create Bucket
  2. Fill Name: Mut be unique in all S3 universe 
  3. Select Region: You should select nearest one (VVIMP: Though you select region here but still the name should ne unique to entire S3 universe )
  4. Couple of more thing (will be covered later)


S3 and Data Consistency :-
1: Read after Write: its consistent, mns you will be able to read the file immdietly after writing it.
2: Read after Delete/Change: This may take some time to reflect, so if you read immedietly after then you may get the previouse version




S3 Storage Classes:-
  1. S3 - Standard : general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data
      Low Latancy - High Throughput -  >= 3 AZ  -
      Storage Fee:  0 till 50TB
      Retrival Fee: NA
  2. S3 IA (infrequently Access) : long-lived, but less frequently accessed data
      Low Latancy - High Throughput -  >= 3 AZ  -  
      Storage Fee:  Yes
      Retrival Fee: Yes
  3. S3 IA - one zone (infrequently Access) : long-lived, but less frequently accessed data
      Best for lessfrequently access data   - Low Latancy - High Throughput -   1 AZ  -  
      This is same as S3-IA except data lies in only one AZ. So risk if AZ goes down and cost lower
  4. S3 Inteligent Tiering: Use AI to move data b\w diffrent tiers without your intervention
  5. S3 Glacier and S3 Glacier deep Archive: for long-term archive and digital preservation
      Take minute and Hours for retrival
    
      
Charges:
  For Storage
  For Request
  For Storage Management
  Data Transfer
  Transfer Acceleration
  Cross border replication
  
Transfer Acceleration: 
  First if you wants to use it then pay for it.
  If you wnants to accelerate the speed of UPLOADing of file on S3 bucket then use it.
  This feature actully uses the heavyweight network of edge-location and cloudFront(instead of typical internet) 
  to maximize the upload speed of the file.
When to use this -
  You have customers that upload to a centralized bucket from all over the world.
  You transfer gigabytes to terabytes of data on a regular basis across continents.
  You are unable to utilize all of your available bandwidth over the Internet when uploading to Amazon S3.

Cross Region replication:-
    First if you wants to use it then pay for it.
    It simply allow the bucket to automatically copy to another bucket in diffrent region. So give you kind of data security




URL of the cucket:-
  A url of the bucket is unique for each indivisual bucket in entire S3 universe
And it pattern is :-
  https://<Bucket Name>.s3.<region Name>.amazonaws.com/<NAme of Item in Bucket>
  https://  muftests3  .s3.  eu-west1   .amazonaws.com/    MufazzalPhoto

Note:
S3 is Object based storage so you can store file but not OS or database. ?????????
Also data store in form of <key> <value> pair in somewhere ???????


How to craete S3 Bucket and and upload file in it by aws portal:-
  Such Spoonfeeding! really

Folder in Bucket:-
  You can create a folder in it and its url path will in in respective of its directory path.

Once a Bucket is created, These are the operation we can do (Over the bucket not indivisual file)
  1. Enable Versioning
  2. Enable static website hosting
  3. Transfer Acceleration
  4. Create event to emit in case of any opration occure on bucket
  5. Set/Unset permission of IAM user/Group
  6. Set Bucket Policy Json
  7. Set Lifecycle (like moving to glacier after certain time or prvius verion archiving)
  8. Replication to another/same region
  ...etc
  [detail will come later]
  
  
Once a file uploaded on Bucket possible operation on File (not Bucket)
  1. Changing storage class
  2. Changing permission
  ...etc
  
  
  
Access of Bucket and its Content:-
There is three way to do it
  1. resource-based policies
      1.1 Bucket Policy
      1.2 ACL (Access control list)
  2. User Policy
    [Detail will come later] 
  
  
 Static website in S3:- 
  1. Create a bucket, mark it public access, place index.html in it
  2. myWebSiteBucket > properties > Static ebsite hosting --> Enable it and select error and index html page
  3. Though bucket is public but content in it is not so now add bucket policy like this to make all the content in the bucket public
      myWebSiteBucket > Permission > Bucket policy
      
        {
          "Version": "2012-10-17",
          "Statement": [
            {
              "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
              "Effect": "Allow",
              "Principal": "*",
              "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject"
              ],
              "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::BUCKET_NAME/*"
              ]
            }
          ]
        }      
        
  
  
  
 #VVIMP: Anything you put intially in S3 in any bucket by default never be public, you have to go and set it after upload.

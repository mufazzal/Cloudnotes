The S3 can sent the Notification of couple of operation to the three AWS service
  1. Lambda
  2. SQS
  3. SNS
  
This is configured at the bucket level but you can filter the scpe by setting Prefix and Tag.  

What kind of notification you can send:-
  You can sen notification of below type-
    see list at 'Supported event types' at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html
    in nutshell this are event to intimate like
    if a object created/deleted/restored/copied etc.

For SNS/SQS the S3 must also gived the service role which look like at page:-
  https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html
  
You can set the event configuration at lambda side or S3 side.


S3 and SNS:-
  To get the certain S3 event on SNS you first need to give S3 a service level access to perform SNS operations of 'sendMessage'
  Simply give S3 bucket right to perform 'senMessage'
  How:
    create a TopicPolicy: see SNSTopicPolicy in 'S3TutoStackCFT.yaml'. This policy will be attached to SNS Topic but not the S3 bucket.
    This simply allow the SNS to let S3 do operation on SNSTOpic  
                            
    Now attach this policy to Bucket like below
      S3TutoPublicRWBucket:
        Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
        DependsOn:
              - SNSTopicPolicy
    Now in properties of bucket just put this:-
        NotificationConfiguration:
          TopicConfigurations:
            - Event: s3:ObjectCreated:Put
              Topic: !Ref SNSTopic
               Filter: 
                  S3Key: 
                   Rules:
                     - Name: "prefix"
                       Value: "private/"    
      This will simply set the SNS to be triggered on PUT operation.      
      
S3 and SQS:-
  This is also very simillar    
   create a QueuePolicy: see SQSQeuePolicy in 'S3TutoStackCFT.yaml'
    Now attach this policy to Bucket like below
      S3TutoPublicRWBucket:
        Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
        DependsOn:
              - SQSQeuePolicy
    Now in properties of bucket just put this:-
        NotificationConfiguration:
          QueueConfigurations:
            - Event: s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete
              Queue: !Ref SQSQeue    
               Filter: 
                  S3Key: 
                   Rules:
                     - Name: "prefix"
                       Value: "private/"      
      This will simply set the SQS to be triggered on Delete operation.   
  
  
  
  ------
  Limitation:-
    You can configure only one even trigger for any operation.

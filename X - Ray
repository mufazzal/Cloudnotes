AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves.
It s used to debug the application for Performance or other issue.
it provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization
you can see detailed information about 
  - the request and response, 
  - calls that your application makes to 
      - downstream AWS resources, 
      - microservices, 
      - databases and 
      - HTTP web APIs
      
X-Ray Service Map:-
  This provide you the detail flow of request in various downstream system with info like
  - Requets response from and to the each system
  - Latency on each system
  - HTTP Header code
  

X-Ray and other AWS services:-
  X-Ray is well integrated with 
  - EC2         : You must install the x-Ray Agent and X-Ray SDK in instance. A role that can push data to X-Ray service.
  - ECS         : X-Ray provides a Docker container image that you must deploy alongside your application. Container instance must have role that can push data to X-Ray service
  - ELB         : Always Enabledd
  - DDB
  - S3          : Send the tracing info to downstream event subscriber like SNS, SQS, Lambda 
  - E Beanstalk : You must install the x-Ray Agent and X-Ray SDK in instance
  - API GAteway : You must enable it
  - Lambda      : You must enable it [On runtimes with a corresponding X-Ray SDK, Lambda also runs the X-Ray daemon for you. also set proper IAM Role for you]
  - SNS
  - SQS
  - On-Premise  : run command to run the Deamon '~/xray-daemon$ ./xray -o -n us-east-2'
  
 X-Ray and Your application:-
  You can use Xray for the application wtitten in
  Java, .Net, GO, Ruby, Python, Node
  

X-Ray For On-Premise or EC2:
  O get data from those service you need to configurre 2 thing
  1. X-Ray Agent:-
      Must be installed in EC2. This Agent ran the X-Ray deamon in the background.
  2. X-Ray SDK:-
      - You can use this SDK to send data to the x-ray which lated you can use to view in diffrent way.
      - It automatically capture the API call made to AWs resources. [So you do not have to worry about it]
      - The X-Ray SDK send the data to X-Ray Deamon which send the the data to X-Ray in batches.
  3. Ec2 Role:-
      The role of ec2 must contain proper permission to upload the data to x-ray service (not cw)
        
Service Map:-
  This is visualization tool to view the flow of the request in downstream systems.

Sagment:-
  The data sent to X-Ray is sent as sagement. 
  This contain the info like
  request, Header response, time, error.

Smapling:-
  You should take care of this thing. X-Ray can generate insanly large data if you sample it too frequently.
  By default the X-Ray SDK records the first request each second, and five percent of any additional requests
  You should disable or set vey low sampling for request like
   - High volume read
   - Polling request
   - Request to syschibg data in back ground
  For creating the Sampling rule you need to set
   - the name of Rule
   - The service that you wants to sample rule applied to
   - Reservoir: minmum number of request(of matching service) the X-Ray must sample
   - Rate: The percentage of matching requests to instrument, after the reservoir is exhausted 

Filter:-
  On the X-Ray log in AWS X-Ray console you can also apply rich filtering for finding specific info.
Group:-
  Out of filter you can also create the Group which is nothinf but collection of segment matching the filter.

Annotations and Metadata:-
  You can add the annotation in the Segmant which later can be used for filtering. This carry info and also indexed
  You can add the metadata in the Segmant but it can not be used for filtering. This carry info but not indexed   

Insight:-
  You can enable the Insight on a Group. This will enable the X-Ray to actively trace the Group data and find anamoly, issue, root cause of issue in it. 

Tracing header:-
  The first X-Ray-integrated service that the request hits adds a tracing header 'X-Amzn-Trace-Id'.

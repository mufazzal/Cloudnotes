AWS X-Ray is a service that collects data about requests that your application serves.
It s used to debug the application for Performance or other issue.
it provides tools you can use to view, filter, and gain insights into that data to identify issues and opportunities for optimization
you can see detailed information about 
  - the request and response, 
  - calls that your application makes to 
      - downstream AWS resources, 
      - microservices, 
      - databases and 
      - HTTP web APIs
      
X-Ray Service Map:-
  This provide you the detail flow of request in various downstream system with info like
  - Requets response from and to the each system
  - Latency on each system
  - HTTP Header code
  

X-Ray and other AWS services:-
  X-Ray is well integrated with 
  - EC2         : You must install the x-Ray Agent and X-Ray SDK in instance
  - ECS         : X-Ray provides a Docker container image that you must deploy alongside your application
  - ELB         : Always Enabled
  - DDB
  - S3          : Send the tracing info to downstream event subscriber like SNS, SQS, Lambda 
  - E Beanstalk : You must install the x-Ray Agent and X-Ray SDK in instance
  - API GAteway : You must enable it
  - Lambda      : You must enable it [On runtimes with a corresponding X-Ray SDK, Lambda also runs the X-Ray daemon. ]
  - SNS
  - SQS
 X-Ray and Your application:-
  You can use Xray for the application wtitten in
  Java, .Net, GO, Ruby, Python, Node
  

X-Ray For On-Premise or EC2:
  O get data from those service you need to configurre 2 thing
  1. X-Ray Agent:-
      Must be installed in EC2. This Agent ran the X-Ray deamon in the background.
  2. X-Ray SDK:-
      - You can use this SDK to send data to the x-ray which lated you can use to view in diffrent way.
      - It automatically capture the API call made to AWs resources. [So you do not have to worry about it]
      - The X-Ray SDK send the data to X-Ray Deamon which send the the data to X-Ray in batches.
    
    
Service Map:-
  This is visualization tool to view the flow of the request in downstream systems.

Sagment:-
  The data sent to X-Ray is sent as sagement. 
  This contain the info like
  request, Header response, time, error.

annotations and metadata:-
  You can add the annotation and metadata in the Segmant which later can be used for filtering.
  
Tracing header:-
  The first X-Ray-integrated service that the request hits adds a tracing header 'X-Amzn-Trace-Id'.

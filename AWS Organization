AWs organization is the feature that let you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
With this:-
  - You can manage the biling via only one account. So you need biling detail in only one account.
  - You can creae new acount with very few detail (only name, email and servicerole)
  - Create service control policies(SCP) to allow/deny access to ceratin aws resouces/service to certain aws account  

VVIMP:-
  AWS account VS IAM Account in cotext of AWS organization: When we are talking about the AWS account it means that the root account. not at all the IAM account
  All IAM account are just a resource inside the rrot account. The aws Organization recognizes only Root Accounts.

How to create:-
  You do not have to be in AWS root(h.mufazzal@gmail.com) account to create the AWS organization. You can crweate it via IAM account too (Mufazzal_Hussain).
  Though the AWS organization make the relation with the root(h.mufazzal@gmil.com) account only. later point of time you can even delete the Mufazzal_Hussain but
  organization persist
    
Concept:-
  Master/management  Account:-
    In any AWS Organization there is only one master account and that is the one with which it is created. 
    in our case its root(h.mufazzal.com) account.
    This account can
      - Create accounts in the organization
      - Invite other existing accounts to the organization
      - Remove accounts from the organization
      - Manage invitations
      - Apply policies to entities (roots, OUs, or accounts) within the organization
      - The management account has the responsibilities of a payer account and is responsible for paying all charges that are accrued by the member accounts
    
  Member Accounts:-
    All other account are member account.
    You can  either create a member accoun with few detail like Email, name and service role. 
    or send the invitation to join the organization to other aws accout,

AWs organization is the feature that let you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage.
With this:-
  - You can manage the biling via only one account. So you need biling detail in only one account.
  - You can creae new acount with very few detail (only name, email and servicerole)
  - Create service control policies(SCP) to allow/deny access to ceratin aws resouces/service to certain aws account  

VVIMP:-
  AWS account VS IAM Account in cotext of AWS organization: When we are talking about the AWS account it means that the root account. not at all the IAM account
  All IAM account are just a resource inside the rrot account. The aws Organization recognizes only Root Accounts.

How to create:-
  You do not have to be in AWS root(h.mufazzal@gmail.com) account to create the AWS organization. You can crweate it via IAM account too (Mufazzal_Hussain).
  Though the AWS organization make the relation with the root(h.mufazzal@gmil.com) account only. later point of time you can even delete the Mufazzal_Hussain but
  organization persist
    
Concept:-
  Master/management  Account:-
    In any AWS Organization there is only one master account and that is the one with which it is created. 
    in our case its root(h.mufazzal.com) account.
    This account can
      - Create accounts in the organization
      - Invite other existing accounts to the organization
      - Remove accounts from the organization
      - Manage invitations
      - Apply policies to entities (roots, OUs, or accounts) within the organization
      - The management account has the responsibilities of a payer account and is responsible for paying all charges that are accrued by the member accounts
    
  Member Accounts:-
    All other account are member account.
    You can  either create a member accoun with few detail like Email, name and service role. 
    or send the invitation to join the organization to other aws accout. you need account id or email for invitation. Now the sendee account has to accept the request.
  
  OU(Organization units):-
    This is the logical collection of account and otyher OU below the root. 
    You can attach the SCP to a OU and that policy will be applied tpo all downward nodes. 
    OU can have only one parent which is other OU or root. also a member account can only pe part of one OU or the root.
    
  SCP (Service Control Policies): 
    Consider this asIAM for your Organization AWS account. It specify the maximum limit of access that the AWS organization account can have,
    SCPs offer central control over your accounts to stay within your organizationâ€™s access control guidelines
    - An SCP restricts permissions for IAM users and roles in member accounts incuding their root user.
    - SCPs affect only member accounts in the organization. They have no effect on users or roles in the management account
    - Users and roles must still be granted permissions with appropriate IAM permission policies
    
  Back Up Policy:-
    - Backup policies give you granular control over backing up your resources at whatever level your organization requires
    - It can be attached to OU or root.
    EG:-
      Policy that DynamoDB table must be back up each week. 
 
  Tag Policy:-
    You can use this to create rule for tagginr the resources across al the account in AWS organization.

Resource Access Manager

AWS RAM is the service with which you can share the resource with
  - Other AWS account
  - In AWS Organization
  - In AWS Organization OU
  
 Consderation: 
  - share the resource with other aws account in aws-organization, you first have to enable it. for sharing with other aws account its not needed to be enabled.
  - The resources are shared at root(h.mufazzal@gmail.com) account level of independent AWS accountot Organization acount.
  - you can only shared the resource you own not the one you are shared with.
 
 Sharing mechnics:-
 For sharing the resource you first have to create the tesource sare and thern add resource in it.
 Now for sahring
  With independent AWS account:-  
    First you have to sent the invitation to that account by email or aws account id. then he will accept it and done. He also can leave the sahring whenever he wants.
  With AWs Organization or OU: 
    It has to be enable if yes then those resources will utomatically apear in all suordinate accounts. no need to acceting. 
    

Creator of resource has full access on the resource's actions. the one with whome it shared can perform action based on type f resource.
Not all the resource are sharable. some example are
  - Capacity Reservations
  - Dedicated Hosts
  - EC2 Images
  - Aurora DB cluster
  - VPC subnet

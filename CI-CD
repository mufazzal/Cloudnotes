In the development today the CI CD is most imp thing to know.

In AWS there is total 3 prime services for this
1.  CodeCommit:   This is like GIT
2.  Codeuild:     This is like Jenkins
3.  CodeDeploy:   A deployment tool
4.  CodePipeline: A service build on top of above three that orchatrate this three to male CI/CD pipeline.

CodeCommit: This is very much like the GIT repository, so you know most of its part. The goal of this is to only manage commit, branch
etc. it do not care what happed to that code. how its buil where ut may deploy.

Codeuild: ????????

CodeDeploy: The task of CodeDeploy is to 
  take the artifact [from S3 or GIT or any othe location]   
  read its 'appSpec.yml' file to read about task to do
  perform this task like
    copy the file from source to dest
    peform some script[at aprticular moment in life cycle] provided in that artifact if provided
    Do health check if provided
  Done.
  
  CodePipeline:-
    This connect all three in a manner they work like a symphone.
    You commit a code via CodeCommit
    CodeBuild creat a artifact and upload at proper locatio
    CodeDeploy detect new artifact and deploy it to proper Ec2 or Lembda

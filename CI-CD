In the development today the CI CD is most imp thing to know.

In AWS there is total 3 prime services for this
1.  CodeCommit:   This is like GIT
2.  Codeuild:     This is like Jenkins
3.  CodeDeploy:   A deployment tool
4.  CodePipeline: A service build on top of above three that orchatrate this three to male CI/CD pipeline.

CodeCommit: This is very much like the GIT repository, so you know most of its part. The goal of this is to only manage commit, branch
etc. it do not care what happed to that code. how its buil where ut may deploy.

Codeuild: ????????

CodeDeploy: The task of CodeDeploy is to 
  take the artifact [from S3 or GIT or any othe location]   
  read its 'appSpec.yml' file to read about task to do
  perform this task like
    copy the file from source to dest
    peform some script[at aprticular moment in life cycle] provided in that artifact if provided
    Do health check if provided
  Done.
  
  CodePipeline:-
    This connect all three in a manner they work like a symphone.
    You commit a code via CodeCommit
    CodeBuild creat a artifact and upload at proper locatio
    CodeDeploy detect new artifact and deploy it to proper Ec2 or Lembda
    
    
  In the AWS CI-CD there is three main component which is 
  CodeCommit
  CodeBuild
  CodeDeploy
  and over all thre is CodePipeline
  But in real world, CodeCommit and CodeBuild has very very strong alternatives
  Most of the time we use git, bitbucket, svn instead of codecommit
  Most of the time we use jenkins instead of codeBuild
  But codeDeploy is indepspensibe as it is very strongly and nicely coupled with EC2 and Lembda.
  
  In most of the project CodeCommit and CodeBuild is not used.
  
  AS i said there are many diffrent combination of tool possible for each starge of development. 
  To abstract them with each other comes a codepipeline
  
  In CodePipleline it does not matter what set of tool you used its so beatifully designed that it mask each stage with each other.

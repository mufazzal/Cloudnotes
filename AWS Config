AWS Config give you way to record and administartor the configuration and relatioship of diffrent AWS components.
Before using the AWS Config you have to srt it up for you Account and Region.
The set up is done per account per region basis. So You have have to do set up in each region if wants to admin on multiple region.

Seting-Up AWS Config:-
	To set up the AWS-Config in yout account and in region you should use the Console. 
	If set has not been run, you will not see any option other then 'set up aws config'. So do it.
	You will need to set below thing in the set up:
	1. Resource Type to record:-
			You can set if you wants to record 
				- All the resources in this region or 
				- Some specific like EC2, Cloudfront, S3.
	2. Delivery Channel:-
			AWS Config sends notifications and updated configuration states through the delivery channel.
			To use the AWS Config you must set it. You have to set a S3 bucket for a delivery channel. 
				- This could be in your account or in other account
				- The region of bucket must be same as of the AWS Config.
				- Thers is only one Delivery chanel per region per account. 
				- You can also set a SNS topic for notification. The Topic could be from your or other account in same region.
	3. Data retention period:
			You could set to store data up to 7 year or less.
	4. Monitor Global rersource: 
			You can set if you wants to track the global resource like IAM user, group also in the AWS-Config
			
	Once you set it up, the AWS Config will start recirding any changes happen on the resource you set to looking for.
	It will start recording.
	
Updating AWS Config:-
	You can stop the recording any tine you wants. in AWS Config > Setting
	You can also change setting of Resource type to look for, Delivery channel and Data Retension preiod too in AWS Config > Setting

Mechanics of AWS Config:-
	When you turn on AWS Config, it first discovers the supported AWS resources that exist in your account and generates a configuration item for each resource
	AWS Config also generates configuration items when the configuration of a resource changes, and it maintains historical records.
	Whenever any configuration changes is done by anyone on monitered resource then AWS-Config make the Describe*** call to get the configuration detail of that resource.
	By default it track for all the resources in the account in that region unless you selected only few resource type at a time of set up.
	AWS Config deliver the Configuration files of resources in the delivery S3 bucket every 6 hour.

Configuration Recorder:-
	The configuration recorder stores the configurations of the supported resources in your account as configuration items. 
	You must first create and then start the configuration recorder before you can start recording
	By default, the configuration recorder records all supported resources
	You are charged service usage fees when AWS Config starts recording configurations

Inventory/Discovered resources:-
	This are the AWS resources that are dicovered by the AWS Config and candidate of monitoring.
	It may also contains the resources that are deleted. You can view then in console or by api.  
	Not all the resource type are supported by AWS-Config.	

Global Resources Monitoring:-
	The global resoures are not tied to any specific AWS region. snd so if you enable the AWS-Config to track the global resources then it may be possible that this 
	resource may also be tracked in other regions. So there will be mutiple AWS-Config tracking will be there for same resource.
	The same recordwill exist in each AWS0Config enabled region.
	SO it better to plan it accordingly and enable the 'track global resource' only in one region.
		
Information of Non-selected AWS resource type:-
	Surprisingly AWS Config track the Creation and Deletion of even non-selected type AWS resources. 
	Thoug it will not track any other detail like configuration and relation etc.
	If you were tracking a resource but later put then off the list of trackable resource then AWS config still keep the older info of that resource.

Querying:-
	You can write the SQL like qury to fetch theresource and its config
	You can fetch it from Single or multiple account and from single or multiple region.	
	
IF your AWS Config is set up then you will have below informations in your hand for monitered resources.

	1. Configuration Items:
			A configuration item represents a point-in-time view of the various attributes of a supported AWS resource that exists in your account.
			It include 
			> Metadata: 						version, time to captire config, is capturing successful, ordering information of config. 
			> Attribute: 						Resource ID, ARN, Tags, time of resource creation, AZ 
			> Relationships: 				Relation with other resources like EC2 with SG or ALB with TG. 
			> Current Configuration:Output of List** or Describe** api for thst resource. 			

	2. Configuration history of Resource:-
			You can answre like 
			 > when the resource was first created
			 > What was its configuration last month
			 > What changes were made yesterday in its config
			 > The configuration history is available to you in multiple formats in selected S3 bucket
			 > If any AWS config rule is applied then you can also see if this resource currently otr in past underwent a Non-Compiant. 
	
	3. Configuration Snapshot:-
			This configuration snapshot is a complete picture of the resources that are being recorded and their configurations
		
	4. Configuration Stream:-
			A configuration stream is an automatically updated list of all configuration items for the resources that AWS Config is recording. 
			Every time a resource is created, modified, or deleted, AWS Config creates a configuration item and adds to the configuration stream

	5. Resource Relationship:-
			AWS Config discovers AWS resources in your account and then creates a map of relationships between AWS resources
		
------------------------------------------------------------	
		
	AWS Config Rules:-
		An AWS Config rule represents your desired configuration settings for specific AWS resources or for an entire AWS account
		AWS Config flags the resource and the rule as noncompliant, and AWS Config notifies you through Amazon SNS
		AWS also provide some predifined managed Rule and you can create your own Config Rule.
                You can set it to run priodically or on change of resouce config change.
		- You can set up the CloudWatch event rule to take action if any AWS-Config Rule compliance fail.
		
	Multi-Account Multi-Region Data Aggregation:-
		Multi-account multi-region data aggregation in AWS Config allows you to aggregate AWS Config configuration and compliance data 
		from multiple accounts and regions into a single account
		
	
You can have only one delivery channel per region per AWS account, and the delivery channel is required to use AWS Config

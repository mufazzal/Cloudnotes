	Configuration history of Resource:-
		You can answre like 
		 > when the resource was first created
		 > What was its configuration last month
		 > What changes were made yesterday in its config
		 > The configuration history is available to you in multiple formats in selected S3 bucket
	
	Configuration Items:
		A configuration item represents a point-in-time view of the various attributes of a supported AWS resource that exists in your account.
		It include Metadata, Attribute, relationships, current configuration, event.
		AWS config create the Configuration Item whenever it detects a change in that resource. 
		EG: It can create a Configuration Item whenever a bucket is created, updated or deleted.

		You must first create and then start the configuration recorder before you can start recording
		By default, the configuration recorder records all supported resources
		
	Configuration Snapshot:-
		This configuration snapshot is a complete picture of the resources that are being recorded and their configurations
		
	Configuration Stream:-
		A configuration stream is an automatically updated list of all configuration items for the resources that AWS Config is recording. 
		Every time a resource is created, modified, or deleted, AWS Config creates a configuration item and adds to the configuration stream
	
	Resource Relationship:-
		AWS Config discovers AWS resources in your account and then creates a map of relationships between AWS resources
		
	AWS Config Rules:-

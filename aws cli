If you login to 'https://console.aws.amazon.com', you see 100s of operaion you can do here like sart/stop ec2, load s3,
operate on glacier. Basically all very high level operations on all aws features.

But this all done via UI.

What if you wants to do it via automation or via remote access.
For this comes 'aws-cli'

In very few word ->
  CLI + https://console.aws.amazon.com   =   aws-cli
aws-cli provide you the bunch of commands to perform many aws operation. 
The most imp use case of this is to write the shell script, that will allocate, invoke and terminate the aws resourses via 
automation at many level.

So how to use it :-
  Prerequisite:  
    1. You should have a aws accout.
    2. A user with 'AdministratorAccess' permission and and acceess type 'Programmatic'
    3. a linux/window pc with aws-cli installed (How? google it)
    
How to create such user (Prerequisite#2) : 
  This will be illustrated deeply in IAM topic but for now 
  login to aws console site -> IAM -> create user group with 'AdministratorAccess' permission
    -> create user -> select access type 'Programmatic access' -> select the group created earlier
    -> IMP save the user-csv file becoz this file has 2 imp keys for this user to login via aws-cli.
    
    This user do not have password, because this user do no have access type 'AWS Management Console access'

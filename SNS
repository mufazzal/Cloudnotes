SNS is a mechanism of push based notifications.

This system helps to build the mechanism to send the notification to diffrent medium like
  SMS
  Email
  Lambda
  Mobile App
  etc.
  
  
  There is two main part in SNS
  1. SNS Topic
  2. SNS subscription
  
  You can create the SNS topic in aws console itself or by SLF template.
  Once created the topic you can add subsctription to that topic in diffrent ways.
  
  LAmbda and SNS topic subscription:-
    do it via aws console or by SLF template
    
  Lambda and sMS/Email subscription:-
    see code in 'SNSTuto' folder
    
 Sending sns notification to the subscriber:-
    see code in 'SNSTuto' folder

Pricing and Limits:-

SNS and AccessPolicy / TopicPolicy:-
  This is very much simillar to bucket policy. This can use to allow/deny the certain Principle for Certain operation on certain resources if certain condition is met.

SNS and redrive policy : Dead Letter Que
  It may be posible that sns message is failed to deliver. this failure can happen at diffrent level
  deliveryu of message on lambda or SQS subscription mau fail if thta lambda failed to insytantiate or SQS is inactive.
  OR
  SMS, Email wtc also may failed to deliver.
  
  To handle this you can set the Dead Etter Que at subscription level.
  HoW
  see code in SNSTuto.
  
  Dead letter que is nothing but a simple SQS que that have messages of failed SNS deliveries.
  
  
  Issue of TopicName in cloudformation:-
    In CFL template if you specify the TopicName then you will not be able to perform any further update via CFL template on the SNS Topic.
    So either do not give TopicName or give new name each time of update [so basically replace on each update]

AWS WAF  VS   AWS GuardDuty

  AWS WAF provide security to HTTP point exposed by ALB, CDN or API gateway. Not the AWS APIs calls.
  AWS GuardDuty provide security to AWS API calls [also S3 object access, lambda]. not the HTTP poing exposed by ALB, CDN or API gateway.
  
  AWS WAF is pro-active, So if the rule matches the the statment of WAF ACL, the request may be allowed or denied at that point only.
  AWS GuardDuty post-active, So it has no right to allow or deny any request 
    instead once request finish, GuardDuty will read its traces from diffrent logs and generate findings for possible incident.

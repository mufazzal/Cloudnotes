The task defination is the ready-to-run template that can be ran in any ECS cluster as a standalone task or in a service.
The task defination contains below information:-
  
  Capabilty Requirments:-
    This tells weather the task can be ran on which kind of host EC2, Fargate or Extarnal. mutiple are possible.
  
  Compute power:-
    Memory size:-
      The total size of RAM you need for this task. this will be futher dole uot to in-running containers
    CPU:-
      The total size of vCPU you need for this task. this will be futher dole uot to in-running containers

  NetworkMode:-
    The task can be ran in diffrent network mode. it could be awsvpc, bridge, host, none  
  
  Roles:-
    There are two role you set in here
    1. ExecutionRole:-
        When the task is instantiated via sercice or stand alone task, then this role is assumed by the ECS agent to perform operations.
    2. TaskRole
        This is the role assumed by the All Containers intantiated when the task ran started running via service or standalone task.
  
  Family:
    Use this to create the logial group of all the containers in this task.
  
  Storage related:-
    EphemeralStorage: 
      This is the storage accesible till task ran. Simply give how much GB you need
    Volumes:
      You can mout EFS, FSX, Docker Volume to all the containers in this task. This is persistent storage
  
  
  Containers:-
    You can add the list of containers images here with each image you also need to give
    - Image Name: 
        From public docker repo or from ECR
    - Memory limit: 
        Set the limit of memory this container can have. if RAM goes above then container will be killed.
    - Port Mapping:
        It will have information about how the host and container port will be mapped. Its values are depend on network configuration
        Container Port:-
          No matter what network config you use, you have to define the exposed port of container in 'Container Port' field.
        Host Port:-
          Its value can be left empty or filled and it will be interpret depend on the nework mode field.
          
      If NetworkMode=none
          You cannot specify the port mapping
      If NetworkMode=bridge
          Host and Container(Exposed port) can have same or diffrent non-zero port number if you wants to use the static port maping
          Container will have exposed port number and Host port must have '0' port number if you wants to use the dynamic port maping          
      If NetworkMode=awsvpc or host
          Leave the Host port blank or fill the same value as Container Port

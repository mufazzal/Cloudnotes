The setting of Deployment and Deployment Configuration is lies in Service.
When you update anuthing in the service it use this setting to propogate the change.

DeploymentController:-
  You can use one of below
    ECS:
      It will do the rolling update. EG if you have 10 container running then it will kill 2 and create 2 new in the service 
      and keep doing it untill all old 10 will be killed and new 10 comes.
      DeploymentConfiguration for Rolling ECS Update:-
        minimumHealthyPercent: 
          Minimum number of container tha should be up and running. Eg. if total is 4 and its value in 50% then 2 container will always be up.
        maximumPercent:
          Define how many max instance it can run at a time. Eg. if total is 4 and its value in 150% then 4+2=6 conatiner can be run max at a time.
          Higher the value will speed up the deployment cecause it will do the replacement of more instances at a time.
    CodeDeploy:
      It will do the BD update with CodeDeploy. It will create new 10 Containerthen give some time to test the new container for prod traffic and finally is all ok
      then kill al the old one and change whole prod traffic to new 10 containers.

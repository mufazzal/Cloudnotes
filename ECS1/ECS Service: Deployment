The setting of Deployment and Deployment Configuration is lies in Service.
When you update anuthing in the service it use this setting to propogate the change.

DeploymentController:-
  You can use one of below
    ECS:
      It will do the rolling update. EG if you have 10 container running then it will kill 2 and create 2 new in the service 
      and keep doing it untill all old 10 will be killed and new 10 comes.
      DeploymentConfiguration for Rolling ECS Update:-
        minimumHealthyPercent: 
          Minimum number of container tha should be up and running. Eg. if total is 4 and its value in 50% then 2 container will always be up.
        maximumPercent:
          Define how many max instance it can run at a time. Eg. if total is 4 and its value in 150% then 4+2=6 conatiner can be run max at a time.
          Higher the value will speed up the deployment cecause it will do the replacement of more instances at a time.
    CodeDeploy:
      It will do the BD update with CodeDeploy. It will create new 10 Containerthen give some time to test the new container for prod traffic and finally is all ok
      then kill al the old one and change whole prod traffic to new 10 containers.
      DeploymentConfiguration for BG ECS Update:-
        For EC2 as host:-
          Here the value of minimumHealthyPercent and maximum Percent both are fixed set to 100% and 200% and cannot be changed. It is because 
          In BG you cannot reduce the capacity so you need 100% of desire count always running at any time and
          at some point in the BG you will need Blue fleet with 100% and green fleet witrh 100% capacity before you shift whole traffic to New instances.
        For Fargete:-
          Its ignored and not used.
      
    External :
      ???

  Health check Consideration while deployment:-
    The ECS service will consider the instance as Healthy if HEalth check of belowe items re passed
    - If there are Essential Containers in the task then those instance must pass the Healthcheck
    - If there is a LB attach then the health check of target instances must also pass.
    - if there is no essential conataner or no healthcheck on any essential container then health check for conatainer instance will be ignored 
    - if there is no load balancer then healthcheck of conatners via LB in the target group will be ignored.

Cognito provide a the end to end solution for user authentication in th application.

Its very much like Red Hat SSO.

here we simply do some set up and then
  sign in
  sign up
  sign in with facebook/google
  sign in with SAML
  is ready for authentication.
  
  
    
  How we set it  up:-
    It onvolve lot of step which cant be covered here.
    but in nutshell
    
    You creat a pool then creat the appclirnt in it
    you give callback url which will be used for redirection once user is succefgully signed in
    You also set if you wants to create a JWT token
    You set the domain name in it also. this is precofugured url with blank domain name, you type the domain name and check avialability
        formate: 
          http://________.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com
    you can customize UI also for login and registration form.
    
  Steps:>
  
  1. go to ASWS > Cognito > Manage user pool > Create User Pool 
  2. Type name of pool say 'mufUserPool' and press Ok
  3. AWS > Cognito > User Pool > 'mufUserPool' 
  4. set up App Integration
      4.1: Click 'App Client' > Add Client 
      4.2 Type name of App Client 
      Done and not the client id here.
  5. Set up App Integration
      go to 'App Client Setting'
        here you set up the callback url on which user will be redirected after successful login. say it is 'exp.com'
        Check 'Cognito User Pool'
        Also in 'Allowed OAuth Flows' check 'Authorization code grant' and 'Implicit grant'
      go to domain name:
        type the domain name and chech availability. This url will lead you to signin/signup page. say we select 'mufpoolau'
   6. UI Customization:
        in sidebar se thisoption. do it if you luke
        
   Done
   
   Now you can use below url for app
   
   <Your Cognito Domain>  /login?response_type=token&client_id= <Your App Client ID>  &redirect_uri= <redirect Url>
   
   
   https://mufpoolau.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com/login?response_type=token&client_id=265c2a544llj0sbk367fpdigin&redirect_uri=https://exp.com
        
   Once you go to this url, you will see the login page with sign up button. you can do both here.
   
   once the login is successful user will be redirected to exp.com
   
  You can view this users in
    AWS > Cognito > 'mufUserPool' > User and Group.
    
    you can also create the grou of user here.
    
    
    You can also use identity provide like facebook, google, saml for auth.

In short in Cognito is Red Hat SSO of AWS.

This is the complete user management system which provide
  1. User sign up via pre-built registration form or via Facebook/Google or via any SAML active directory.
  2. User sign in via pre-built login form or via Facebook/Google or via any SAML active directory.
  3. USer delete/enable/password change etc functions.
  4. It can be used as federation authentication via OAuth 2.0 for other Apps.
  5. User pool with identity pool provide strong binding with IAM for user access management over AWS services like S3 etc.
  6. strongly coupled with Lambda for authentication.
  
  Only User Pool  ->  Authentication
  User Pool + Identity Pool -> Authentication + Autherization.
  
  User Pool and FB/Gmail/SAML :-
    The cognito user pool is directory of user. In this directory user can register himself with form or FB or gamil or SAML anything.
    Of course the developer has to configure each of thi id provide if required.
  
  UserPool and User:-
    The User pool will have one entry for each user no matter he registered with Form, FB, Gmail, SAML etc.
    No matter how he register hinmself, they will be logged in via same Login page. Of cource this page will have option of 
    Login via Username/Password, By FB, BY Gmail, By SAML.
  
  UserPool and App Client:-
    The user pool in himself can also work as fedrated Authenticator, which can Authenticate the user on behalf of Client APp via Oauth 2.0
    For this the Client App has to register himself with UsePool with Name and redirectUrl.
    Each of Client App will then be provided with Client_id and also of he need them client_secret.
    
    
    So there is thre major data table prsent in each userPool
        1. Its integration detail with FB/Gmail/SAML etc.
        2. The user table. which has credetial (username/password or FB ID or Gmail Id or SAML id) for each indivisual user
        3. The list of App Client register with userPool who wants to authenticate user by userpool on his behalf.
        
        
        In nutshell it look like this-       
                                                                            
                                   AS

user pool and Federation-id-provider set up:-
    Here you set the necessary information about how the diffrent id provider(FB, Gmil, SAML) are integrated with your uerpool.
    This is regarding 'Federation-integration data' in the above figure.
    In AWS console:-
        AWS > Cognito > manage usetr pool > select your pool > in Federation select identity provider
        You can see diffrent options like FB, Gmail, SAML here.
        fill the data for the id provider you wants to integrate.
   This is one time activity for each provider and developer has to do it at a time of set up 
  
user pool and and App Client:-
    The App client who uses the userpool for on his behalf to authenticate the user.
    Each App client has to register himself.
    As like in OAuth 2.0 for any client to register he need to provide the name and Callbackurl.
    and then the userPool (our Authentiction server) will return him the Client_id and Client_Secret(if needed)
    Later clients will use this information to authenticate the user on its behalf.
    
    This is also one time activity for each client.
    
user pool and and user table:-
    This is where the data about the usr lie. For each user either he register via form, FB, Gmail, SAML 
    there will be one row for that user.
  
So no matter its for uerPool himself or on behalf of any App Client, for login the user will be presented with the Login Page 
owned completely by the userpool. This page do have options to either login by diffrent mean like.

The OAuth 2.0 is the way to do the Authentication between parties.

There is four party here

1. Resource Owner : User :-  The one who know the username and password
2. Client :              :-  The one who need to have access on some protected resource Or himself is the protected resource.
3. Autherization Server  :-  The one who has directory of authenticated owners(users) and owen the logic of authentication
4. Resource Server       :-  The one who has the protected resources.

IMP: Resource Server may or may not come ino picture for Authentication flow.

Resource Owner: 
  This is the end user. who know the username and password or social login detail or any personal info that need for authorization
  It could be
    h.mufazzal@gmail.com
    Fatema
    7387486776
    etc.

Client: 
  Client could be of two type
  Non trusted with 'Resource Server' :-
    A intemediatory between 'Resource Owner' and 'Resource Server'. who do nothing but call the APIs (non authenticated) of 
    'Resource Server' and assume that resource server will check if user is authorized or not.
    Think of client a front end and REsource server as back end with session detail + accesa token from 'Autherization Server' of each session 
    EX: 
  Trusted with or without 'Resource Server':-
    When you are sure that your client is trusted and the communication between the Client and Resorce Server is secured.
    You place all responsibility of authentication to Client and resource server does not come in picture.

  EG:  Any web app or mobile, this is for the developer of that app i to decide that does he trust the app fully or not.

 Autherization Server: 
  This is where all the user credention info or social info or any othe rinfo lie which can be used to verify user identity.
  This also own the logic of identification. It own the Login UI page also whhere user fill its login detail.

Resource Server:
  This is where the protected resources lie.
  EG. the server who hist the APIs. 

---

When resource server is protected resource not client->
The 'Client' Wants 'Autherization Server' to verify the 'Resource Owner' authenticity and give client the TOKEN so that client can let user
access the protected resources at 'Resource Server'

OR

When client is protected resource->
The 'Client' Wants 'Autherization Server' to verify the 'Resource Owner' authenticity and give client the TOKEN so that he can let user use
the client.
---


Client and Autherization Server initial set up:-
  Authentication server guarantee the user identity and The client need this guarantee 
  so they both need to first make some contract between them, this is one time activity where the Client need to register himself at 'Autherization Server'
  How this contract look like
  At AS the client need to provide below info
  1. Name
  2. Callback url : This is the url where user will be redirected to onece user complete the authorizaion successfully/unsuccessfully 
    This two are mosy imp info client need to provide, AS may ask for some more detail.
  In return the AS give 2 things to Client to note down
  1. Client ID: a ub=nique id of client among all other client registerd at AS
  2. Client Secret (Opional) : AS will provide the client secret if you wants. which the client should not share with any one.
      Client Secret must be placed at trusted location. if you trust client then place it there otherwise are RS
    
So what AS has:-
  This list of user credential, the logic of user identity verification, the list of registerd clint with there name, clent id and secret.
  View of AS, Client, RS if we trust the Client

Oauth 2.0 define 4 diffrent kind of flow mechanism for uthentication between multiple party.
They should be used on scenario basis.

This 4 are
  Authorizaion Code Grant
  Implicit Grant
  Client Credential

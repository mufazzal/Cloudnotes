This is one if the very amazing service of AWS Cognito.

In Simplest term it provide the data Synchronization for 'h.mufazzal@gmail.com' to its laptop, mobile, PC and watch etc.

The CSY provide synching og application related synching of data wrt to cognito user of that application.
Once login on multiple device via cognito based authentication by same user, those all devices remain in synch via silent notifications.

For this CSY create the fully managed back-end for you and you just have to write the proper front end on the compatible devices.

Arch:-
  Cognito_id_pool_user    Dataset
  h.mufazzal@gmail.com    {a:b, c:d}     --------------> mufazzal's phone, chrome, lappy etcc
  fatema@gmail.com        {k:l, m:n}     --------------> fatema's phone, chrome, lappy etcc
  ...

  CSY Client library:-
    - This lib keep the user data in cache of your App, your app read and write the data in cache only ia the client libs.
    - For rading and writing on cache you never need a internet connection
    - IF connectivity available then you can Synch the data with back end 
    - The back end is fully managed by AWS so you never have to worry about it.
    - You can also set up 'push synch' to immediatly inform other logged in devices for the new changes in data set.  
  
  Data Set:-
    Data for any user in the id pool is saved in form of key-value pair. collection of this pair is called Data set.
    For a single identity you can have maximium 20 data set. and each data set can have many Key-Value pair.
    EG:- for use in the id pool 'mufazzal' you can have 3 data set like
    profile_data_set:  {name, address, gae}
    scores_data_set: {best, rank, rankinindia}
    awards_data_set: {totalPoint, milestone, badges}
    
    Creating data set in android:-
      Dataset dataset = client.openOrCreateDataset("datasetname");
    Reading and Writing Data in Datasets
      String value = dataset.get("name");
      dataset.put("age", "32);        
  
  Data Synch:-
    For this you need the Identity-Pool and Client libs.
    Synch data set in android:- 
      dataset.synchronize(syncCallback);

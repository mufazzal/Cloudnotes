This is one if the very amazing service of AWS Cognito.

In Simplest term it provide the data Synchronization for 'h.mufazzal@gmail.com' to its laptop, mobile, PC and watch etc.

The CSY provide synching og application related synching of data wrt to cognito user of that application.
Once login on multiple device via cognito based authentication by same user, those all devices remain in synch via silent notifications.

For this CSY create the fully managed back-end for you and you just have to write the proper front end on the compatible devices.

Arch:-
  Cognito_id_pool_user    Dataset
  h.mufazzal@gmail.com    {a:b, c:d}     --------------> mufazzal's phone, chrome, lappy etcc
  fatema@gmail.com        {k:l, m:n}     --------------> fatema's phone, chrome, lappy etcc
  ...
  ...
  
  CSY Client library:-
    - This lib keep the user data in cache of your App, your app read and write the data in cache only ia the client libs.
    - For rading and writing on cache you never need a internet connection
    - IF connectivity available then you can Synch the data with back end 
    - The back end is fully managed by AWS so you never have to worry about it.
    - You can also set up 'push synch' to immediatly inform other logged in devices for the new changes in data set.  
  
  Data Set:-
    Data for any user in the id pool is saved in form of key-value pair. collection of this pair is called Data set.
    - For a single identity you can have maximium 20 data set. and each data set can have many Key-Value pair.
    - Each dataset can have a maximum size of 1 MB
    EG:- for use in the id pool 'mufazzal' you can have 3 data set like
    profile_data_set:  {name, address, gae}
    scores_data_set: {best, rank, rankinindia}
    awards_data_set: {totalPoint, milestone, badges}
    
    Creating data set in android:-
      Dataset dataset = client.openOrCreateDataset("datasetname");
    Reading and Writing Data in Datasets
      String value = dataset.get("name");
      dataset.put("age", "32);        
  
  Data Synch:-
    For this you need the Identity-Pool and Client libs.
    Synch data set in android:- 
      dataset.synchronize(syncCallback);
    Push Synch:-
      IF you enable this then all the devices with login will be notified via a silent notification if there is any update on data set.
      Push Synch listener in android:-
        Use BroadCastReciver
        
  Cognito Stream:-
    As COgnito Synch give you real time data synch between multiple devices for same identity. and you do not need to provision any back end for synching.
    But you can listen the ongoing changes in the user identity via a Kenesis tream.
    Amazon Cognito can push each dataset change to a Kinesis stream you own in real time.
    - You can use this to analyze the changes and process and store it for further analysis.
    - You need a sevice ro;e for Cognito that have permission to seng data to stream
    - You can use existing or new stream for this.
    Eveent-Data cell in stream:-
        {
            "identityPoolId": "Pool Id",
            "identityId": "Identity Id",
            "dataSetName": "Dataset Name",
            "operation": "(replace|remove)",
            "kinesisSyncRecords": [
                {
                    "key": "Key",
                    "value": "Value",
                    "syncCount": 1,
                    "lastModifiedDate": 1424801824343,
                    "deviceLastModifiedDate": 1424801824343,
                    "op": "(replace|remove)"
                },
                ...
            ],
            "lastModifiedDate": 1424801824343,
            "kinesisSyncRecordsURL": "S3Url",
            "payloadType": "(S3Url|Inline)",
            "syncCount": 1
        }    

-------------
  Cognito Event:-
    When any changes are made in the data set by any device and then it suched and published with other device, for this moment you can set up the 
    lambda trigger (Sync Trigger) that will be called right befor the data synched to other device.
    You can use this lambda to make chnages in the data set that are going to synch.
    For this you have to set up the proper lambda function as Synch Trigger for an Identity Pool.
    - Amazon Cognito will provide all the records present in the dataset as input to the function.
    - Records updated by the app user will have the 'op' = “replace” and the records deleted will have 'op'= "remove".
    - You can modify any record
    - To modify the value of a record, simply update the value and set the 'op' to "replace".
    - To add a record, simply add a new record to the datasetRecords array.

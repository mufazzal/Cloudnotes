When we make any application we may need lot of resources, like 10s of DB, 100s of CPU, 10s of LB etc.
As we have studuied in Networking chaprer that number of public IPv4 is limited so we cannot give all of them public IP.

For this we generally create private network.
This is done via VPC in aws. VPC stand for Virtual Private Cloud.

By VPC you can create a isolated private cloud in the aws system.
BAsically VPC are small isolated space where the nodeof an application lies.

Suppose you wants to create 2 application one for shop and one for Bank in same AWS account.

For this we will create two VPC:-
  1.  AWS COnsole > VPC > Create VPC
  2.  Select CIDR block
        TRhe CIDR block availabe in any VPC is in range of 10.0.0.0/16  to   10.0.0.0/24.
        Depending on your requirment you can choose the CIDR size. This CIDR rage of IP is lie in resrved range of PRivate NEtwork 
        [see Network.txt IP reservation table ]
        If you take 10.0.0.0/16 CIDR then you have total 2^16 IPs avaialaiable from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255
        If you take 10.0.0.0/18 CIDR then you have total 2^14 IPs 
        If you take 10.0.0.0/24 CIDR then you have total 2^6 IPs avaialaiable from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255
        ...
  Each VPC is isolated Private network in itself, The yiu can use any reserve IP in any VPC for a sigle node only at once.
  But you can use the same IP in another VPC again.
  
  EG: in muffy home private network(VPC-muf) you can have an IP 192.168.0.100 also
      in moiz home private network(VPC-moiz) you can have an IP 192.168.0.100
        
   
   Suppose for two pplication of shop and Bank you create a two VPC each
    VPC-Shop   CIDR  10.0.0.0/24      -> App is relativly small so may not need lot of Node so lets have 2^8 IP
    VPC-Bank   CIDR  10.0.0.0/16      -> App is relativly big so may not lot of Node so lets have 2^16 IPs
    
    
    Subnet:-
      The next IMP building block come in VPC is subnet. Once tou craeted the VPC you can devide the VPC in another level of small private network
      You can create as many subnet in a VPC you wants. The CIDR block you have selected for VPC will be shared among all those Subnet.
      Subnet is of two type
        a.  Public Subnet: those who are connected to internet
        b.  Private Subnet: those who are not connected to internet
      Subnet are very useful to devide the resources and partition them among diffrent department of any organization.
      Creating Subnet:-
         1.  AWS COnsole > Subnet > Create Subnet
         2.  Choose name
         3.  Select the VPC
                The Subnet will lie in this VPC
         4. CIDR of subnet
                This CIDR is subset of VPC-CIDR. If the subnet going to have many nodes then you should take large CIDR 
                to register good amount of IPs (avaialble in VPC-CIDR)
         5. Availability Zone: Select the AZ of your choice ar leave to to choze by amazon itself.
         DONE                    

      lets create a subnet for BAnk:-        
        sub_finance            10.0.1.0/24          out of 10.0.0.0/16 [2^16] IP lets reverve 10.0.1.0/24 [2^8] IP for finance deparments apps
        sub_Insurence          10.0.2.0/24          out of 10.0.0.0/16 [2^16] IP lets reverve 10.0.2.0/24 [2^8] IP for finance deparments apps
        sub_intBanking         10.0.3.0/24          out of 10.0.0.0/16 [2^16] IP lets reverve 10.0.3.0/24 [2^8] IP for finance deparments apps
        sub_staticweb          10.0.4.0/30          out of 10.0.0.0/16 [2^16] IP lets reverve 10.0.4.0/30 [2^2] IP for finance deparments apps
        
      Simillarly you can create the Subnet for VPC-Shop  
        sub_account            10.0.0.128/26          
        sub_eccomerce          10.0.0.64/28          
        sub_inventory          10.0.0.32/28          
        sub_staticweb          10.0.0.16/30    
        
        USE https://cidr.xyz/ for detail calculation.
        
    Routing Table:-
      The next IMP building block in VPC is Routing Table. 
      The routing table is simplly a table which has entery of IP or CIDR against the Node. 
      It is actully a master table for all the routing decision happen in Subnet.
      
      A routing table can be attach to multiple Subnet But a subnet can have one ane only one Routing table attach to it.
      But a routing table can be attach to only one VPC. Means all the subnet that are attach to any routing table must belongs to same VPC.
      So its relation is
        
                                Subnet 1      
        Routing Table--------   Subnet 2
                                Subnet 3

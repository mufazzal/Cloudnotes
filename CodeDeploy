Why wwe need it :-
  Say you have a EC2s running on version1 of code and nw you wants to upgrade the version to next
  What you will do
  1. you have to stop the App or stop the EC2 if it is Blue/Greem deployment
  2. now you have to login to instances of EC2 with proper user
  3. Now you have to upload the new code 
  4. Now you have to make chages in the configuration if needed and run some script if needed.
  5. Now you have start the App.
  6. Now you may also run a script for health check
  
The code deploy help the user to automate the above process of deploying. 
Here you have to provide 
  The Source: The location of 'Artifact' on S3 or github or other
    Inside the artifat lies
      1. The new Code
      2. Appspec.yml file.
      3. Scripts that you wants to run at events of deployment life cycle
  The Destination: Wher you wants to deploy, 
    On EC2
      - On EC2s of specific tags
      - On a Autoscalling group of EC2
      - On premise instances.
    On LAmbde
      ???????????????
      
 VVIMP: Code deploy automate the steps of deploment in the EC2/LEmbda But it not at all automate the deployment if a new artifact 
        come in the source location. For this you have to use the CodePipeline.
      
      
      
      
Ec2 - CodeDeploy :- 
  if you wants to deploy the code with codedeply on EC2 you have to install the 'CodeDeploAgent' on EC2 instance.
  THis is one time activity for EC2. once it is installed you will be able to use the CodeDeploy for automation.

Suppose you wants to do an operation like
  A file upload to S3 bucket
  Change in DynamoDB table
  get the data from RDS
  ETC.
  
  
  To perform this operation we need couple of permission.
 
  Depending on what level of fine grain access managemet you want, you xcan set up the permission mechanism.
  
  1: At Back End:  Permission to the Conputing System itself (EC2 or Lambda-API-Getway):-
      Give role to lambda or EC2 via console
  2: At Back End: Permission to IAM User and log-in into the Conputing System (EC2 or Lambda-API-Getway)
      2.1 EC2: 'aws configure'
      2.2 Lambda: ???????
  3: At Front End : Permission to the logged in APP-User [not IAM user] via identity pool
      Create the identity pool for fine user poll and appclient. 
      Create a role for authenticated and unauthenticated app-user and give this role the access to certain resources.
      generate the accesskay nad secret for that user and use theis keys to access the resource.
  4: At Front End : By giving the Access-key and Secret directly in code : never do it.

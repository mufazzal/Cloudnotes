RDS is the service that provide a way to integrate the Relation Databse.

#SDB
There is 6 RDB supported
  SQLSever
  ORACLE
  MySql
  PostgresSql
  Amazon Aurora : amazon itself
  MariaDb
  
  
Lets create a RDS instance with SQLServer :-
  
  AWS Console > RDS > Create DB  
  Engine options: Select which kind of DB and its version you wants to select from list #SDB
  DB instance identifier: A unique id that must be unique among all DB instance that are in your AWS account 'mufdatabaseinstance'
  Master username/Password: A user who will defining  users, objects, and permissions in the databases
  DB instance size: Chosse the proper one depending on computational poewer you need.
  Storage Type: 
    General Purpose (SSD) -> suitable for a broad range of database workloads. Provides baseline of 3 IOPS/GiB and ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS.
    Provisioned IOPS (SSD) -> suitable for I/O-intensive database workloads. Provides flexibility to provision I/O ranging from 1,000 to 30,000 IOPS.
  Storage autoscalingInfo: let it be default ??????
  Availability & durability: AWS keep the stadby replica of DB in cas of emergency.
  Now just press 'Creat Database' leave all other default. and u r done
  
  You have created the DB now.
  Lets now connect it with other things
  
  As like the any 
  linux machine connect     at SSH port 22
  window machine connect    at RDP port 3892
  MySql Databse  connect    at TCP port 3306
  
  So to let it connect with outside word we need to open the 3306 port of this RDS DB instance
  How  
  open the DB page by clicking 'mufdatabaseinstance' and click on vlaue of 'VPC security groups'
  VPC Security group: 
    This is simply a firwall around our DB. This firwall should leave the proper port (3306 for mysql) open for client
    (This client could be a IP, CIDR or security group)
    How a security group can also be a point of connction for other security group 
    Still A question ?????
    But for now lets open the TCP 3306 port to all so that anybody can connect our sql DB
  DB connection string:
    Note the VPC url from  RDS > 'mufdatabaseinstance' > DB url
    It formate is : ))))))))))))))))))))))))))
    Also keep the note of root user you created at the time DB creation (rootUsername, rootPassword)
  
    
  How to connect with MySql workbench in you PC
  will see later ????
  How to connect with EC2-webserver instance.
  For this we first launch the EC2 instance and make it a webserver
  How? We have already seen it
  So create EC2 web server, select proper security group as such EC2 have HTTP-80 and TCP-22 open
  ##VVIMP: Why not TCP-3306: Because this  EC2 is not a databese itself, it will make a connection with DB at the port-3306 of DB

 The web-server created with EC2 may be built with any software likme apache etc.
 We will place wither our java(war file), php, nodejs code in proper directory (var/www/html) 
 
 To connect the DB at amazon RDS we will write simillar kind od code 
  phpDBLib.connect('DB connection string', '3306', rootUsername, rootPassword)
  OR
  javaDBLib.connect('DB connection string', '3306',rootUsername, rootPassword)
  OR
  etc.

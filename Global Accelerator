Why we need Global Accelarator?

Suppose you have the application that has the Global user base and you need low latency with higher availibility in all region.
EG: PUBG.
If you deploy the app stack in one region, it may faster in that region and slower in rest on the world.
So you need to deploy in many region. But this also bring one more challange.
This is to maintain the emdoints in many region. 
EG.  you need to maintain the multiple ALB, EC2, RDS etc in diffrent region. and in the application code you wil have 
			lot of enpoint url, IP, to mainyains.

To resolve this issue comes a 'Global Accelerator'.

GA provide the single point entry for all the users in the world, irrespective of where the user is.
GA do this by assigning the two Anycast IP (1 for use and 1 for failover of first) and also a DNS mapped to that IP.
AnycastIP: This are the special kinf public IP which can be assign to multiple server. 

You can use this DNS for reaching into the system. The GA will then analyze certain factor and navigte the request to preferable region.

Ingredient of GA:-
	Listener:-
		GA listen the internet traffic on the listener. The listener tells the port and protocol to listen.
		You can have multiple listener ifyou need to listen multiple port and lrotocol.
		EG: you can create listener to listen TCP:80, TCP:3000 etc.
	Endpoint:-
		The endpoint is running aws service or instances of service in the given region. This could be 
		ALB, NLB, EC2, EIP
	Endpoint Group:-
		EPG is the logical collection of endpoints from the SAME REGION which perform the same kind of task(or host same apps).		
		
	Suppose in US-east-1 you have  
		- A webserver runing at EC2s@TCP:80 and exposed by 2 ALB (us1_ws_alb1 and us1_ws_alb2)
		- A appserver runing at EC2s@TCP:30 and exposed by 2 ALB (us1_as_alb1 and us1_as_alb2)
		- A EC2 for monitoring at EC2s@TCP:22:11.11.11.11
	You have same infra in india as
		- A webserver runing at EC2s@TCP:80 and exposed by 2 ALB (in1_ws_alb1 and in1_ws_alb2)
		- A appserver runing at EC2s@TCP:30 and exposed by 2 ALB (in1_as_alb1 and in1_as_alb2)
		- A EC2 for monitoring at EC2s@TCP:22:13.13.13.13
		
	As you ca imagine there are 3 ALB fro a webserver and 3 for appserver. 
	So in typicla infra you have to manage the DNS of this 8 ALB in code of appserver and webserver.
	Chaging the ALB dnam name will take heavy toll. and also you have to take care of traffic ditribution among them.
	
	With GA you can avoid this overheads.
	
	Steps:-
		Create the GA, it will gives you a DNS name and twi anycast IP. say its mufga.globalaccelerator.amazonaws.com.
		Now create three LISTENER in this GA for  
			- first for the webserver. 	 use port and protocol as TCP and 80. say LIS_WS (you can have diffrent port if you wants to do port overriding)
			- second for the appserver.  use port and protocol as TCP and 30. say LIS_AS (you can have diffrent port if you wants to do port overriding)
			- third for the maintanance. use port and protocol as TCP and 22. say LIS_MT (you can have diffrent port if you wants to do port overriding)
				So now your GA will listen to 
					http://mufga.globalaccelerator.amazonaws.com:80, http://mufga.globalaccelerator.amazonaws.com:30, SSH:mufga.globalaccelerator.amazonaws.com:10
		Now create the END POINT GROUP, Create 3 EPG, 1 for each server and for each region
			- for webserver in US-east-1 say EPG_WS_US and attach it to LIS_WS
			- for webserver in india say EPG_WS_IN and attach it to 		LIS_WS
			
			- for appserver in US-east-1 say EPG_AS_US and attach it to LIS_AS
			- for appserver in india say EPG_AS_IN and attach it to 		LIS_AS
			
			- for maint server in US-east-1 say EPG_MS_US and attach it to 	LIS_MS
			- for maint server in india say EPG_MS_IN and attach it to 			LIS_MS			
		
		Now finaly add Endpoint to each of this EPG. In the each EPG you will have the endpoint which will have common region and common listener.
			So the EPGs will look like below
			EPG_WS_US:-
				us1_ws_alb1, us1_ws_alb2
			EPG_WS_IN:-
				in1_ws_alb1, in1_ws_alb2
			So now you can see that that the Webserver is exposed via GA throght 
				1 listener 'LIS_WS'
				2 EPG (listening on same listener LIS_WS)
				4 Endoint (spread in 2 region via 2 EPG). 
				So now you WS is highly available im multiple region. 
			Now for App server
			EPG_AS_US:-
				us1_as_alb1, us1_as_alb2
			EPG_AS_IN:-
				in1_as_alb1, in1_as_alb2
			So now you can see that that the Appserver is exposed via GA throght 
				1 listener 'LIS_AS'
				2 EPG (listening on same listener LIS_AS)
				4 Endoint (spread in 2 region via 2 EPG). 
				So now you AS is highly available im multiple region. 			
				

- AWS Global Accelerator utilizes the Amazon global network rather then internet for fast performance.

Traffic Distribution:-
	You can use Traffic Dial to distribute traffic among EPG.
	Then you can furthure use the Weight to distribute the traffic among EP in that EPG.

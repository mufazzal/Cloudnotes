To create the LB via CFR you need to work on three parts, just like you create the LB via aws console.

Part 1. Create Target Group just like step 8 [Routing/Target Group: ] in LB.txt
Part 2. Create Listener for LB just like step 5 [Listener ] in LB.txt
Part 3: Create the The LB itself


Creating Target Group:-
  Target Group tell the LB about which EC2 he need to forward the traffic and How(por and protocol)
  We can either the Add the EC2s in it or set some ASG as such that the ASG launch and add the EC2 here.
  we can also leave it empty so that the developer add the EC2 later.

Craeting Listener:- 
          "LBLIS": {
            "Type" : "AWS::ElasticLoadBalancingV2::Listener",
            "Properties" : {
                "DefaultActions" : [ Action, ... ],
                "LoadBalancerArn" : String,
                "Port" : Integer,
                "Protocol" : String,
              }
          }  
   This will tell the LB that what kind of traffic he has to listen and then how and where he need to route it.
   LoadBalancerArn: the arn of load balancer you will create in 'Part 3'
   Port and Protocol: the traffic that LB should listen.
   DefaultActions: What to do to the traffic coming from mentioned port and protocol and where to rote it.
    The typical formate of DefaultActions is mentioned below
    this syas that   forward the traffic to Target group 'LBTRG' that we created in 'part 1'
               "DefaultActions": [{
                        "Type": "forward",
                        "TargetGroupArn": { "Ref": "LBTRG"}
                 }]   
    Listener is the most imp part in here. This connect the Target Group(LBTRG) of Part 1 and the Load Balancer(MALB) of part 3.

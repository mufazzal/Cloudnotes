This is somthing you cannot define in few wprld

But say! its a tool to create the whole application stack with GUI.


Elastic Beanstalk VS CloudFormation
CloudFormation a great grand father of Elastic Beanstalk.
ELB is not programmable meaning you set up an preconfigured application either for hello world or with existing code (war/zip)
CloudFormation is the soluction where you can change, create, delete, update all the diffrent parts(EC2, S3 ..) of your app. Its completely programmable.

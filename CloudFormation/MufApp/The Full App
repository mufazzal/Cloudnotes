We will create a full app of EC2 with 
  SGs.
  EC2s
  ASG
  Lanunch Config for ASG
  LB
  Target Group for LB
We will let user choose his VPC, Subnet and ssh key pair.


To create all this we know there is lot of interdependencis. We will go through in proper sequence to create the app.

1. The first thing which is very much independent among all is SGs.
    and we will create the SGs as that the 
    EC2's Sg will accept the inbound traffic from ALB' SG only.
    
    So create the SG for EC2 and ALB.
      see the template 'OnlySG'
      
      
 2. Nest thing we could make is LanuchConfiguration.

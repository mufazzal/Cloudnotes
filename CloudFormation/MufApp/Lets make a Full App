We will create a full app of EC2 with 
  SGs.
  EC2s
  ASG
  Lanunch Config for ASG
  LB
  Target Group for LB
We will let user choose his VPC, Subnet and ssh key pair.


To create all this we know there is lot of interdependencis. We will go through in proper sequence to create the app.

1. The first thing which is very much independent among all is SGs.
    and we will create the SGs as that the 
    EC2's Sg will accept the inbound traffic from ALB' SG only.    
    So create the SG for EC2 and ALB. see the template 'step 1- SG creation'  
    Two SG are
      ALBSG : for LB -> open to internet at inbound HTTP:80
      EC2SG : for EC2 -> open to only LB at inboud HTTP:80 
      
 2. Next thing we could make is LanuchConfiguration.
      Here we will create the 'LanuchConfiguration' with all necessary properties we wants in launched instances.
      See the template 'Step 2 - LanuchConfiguration' where we make it as 'EC2LAunchConfig'
      The LanuchConfiguration has the SG assosiated to it. Though we do not specify the VPC here. But you have to take care
      that once the EC2 are launched then the SG setted here must lie in VPS where EC2 is launched.
      
        AssociatePublicIpAddress-> Set this true if you wants each of the EC2 to have an public IP.
        
  3. Next thing we will make the ASG. 
      Here we will specify that in what subnets (so vpc too) we will launch the instances and what kind of min/max capacity we need.
      We will create 'ASGEC2' here.
      For now here we are only setting the minmax capacity but not any policy to scale up and down.
      
    
  4.  The LB is created in 3 parts as we discussed.
      So we devide this step in three part.
      4.1 First we will create the Target Group(LBTRG) with info about the opened port.
      4.2 Create LB(MALB), with SG(ALBSG) that let inbound HTTP:80 open for internet
      4.3 Crate listener (LBLIS) which connect the MALB and LBTRG.
      See it in 'Step 4 - LB'

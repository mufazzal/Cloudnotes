PAAS			      Application				      Hardware and OS							      :You just give the the code of your app and they will take care of all extra overhead: 
Serverless		  Function				        App load								          :You just give small pices of code of your app : 

In all above three there is one thing common. You need a machine up and running all the time your app is live.
and whole things of the app has to be in running state all the time. so all the time you need either a server at data center or EC2 at aws up.
All has to be Up and running even though you do not really need anyting or something.

To solve this comes a serverless
In sercerless you tear down your application in very very small piceses. So small that you use a tiny function to define it.
This function sits idle somwhere in AWS without taking any kind of computing power. But when someone trigger it. 
It will automatically allocate EC2 for itself, run itself, deallocate EC2 and again go in idle state.
It will automatically scale up or down itself if load is high or low.
By this way you save lot of money by saving the idle running time of EC2.


Principle of Serverless:-
  1. You execute a single pice of code on demand and so use compute power for that execution only
  2. The single piece of code should be stateless
  3. Use push based event driven pipeline
  4. Thicked Front End
  5. Same serverless function can at multiple instances. So they can run in paraller

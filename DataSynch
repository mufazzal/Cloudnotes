The AWS Data Synch is used to migrate the data 
- to and from the AWS cloud to on-premise.
- to and from between diffrent cloud services.

The source and destination could be:-
  - On premise Network File System (NFS), 
  - On premise Server Message Block (SMB) file servers, 
  - On premise self-managed object storage
  - S3/Glacier
  - EFS
  - FSX
  
Mechanics:
  Data transfer between On-premise and AWS:-
    You need to install the AWS Synch Agent at on-premise
  Between two AWS service in Same Account [inter or intra-regoin]:-
    You do not need to Synch Agent
  Between two AWS service in diffrent Account [inter or intra-regoin]:-
    You need DataSync EC2 agent deployed in a Region

Componment:-  
  Agent, Locations, Task, Task execution
  
VerifyMode:-
  You can enable or disble it. if enable then DataSynch will verify all the transfer data after completion of transfer.
Phases:-
LAUNCHING: 
  DataSync initializes the task execution
PREPARING: 
  DataSync examines the source and destination file systems to determine which files to sync. 
  It does so by recursively scanning the contents and metadata of files on the source and destination file systems for differences
TRANSFERRING:
  After the scanning is done and the differences are calculated, DataSync transitions to the TRANSFERRING status. it copy the diffrence of data and metadata.
  When DataSync transfers data, it always performs data integrity checks during the transfer.
VERIFYING: 
  This phase will come only if verify mode is enabled.
  You can enable additional verification to compare source and destination at the end of a transfer.
SUCCESS/ERROR:
  You know it.
  
How AWS DataSync verifies data integrity:-
  AWS DataSync locally calculates the checksum of every file in the source file system and the destination and compares them. Additionally, 
  DataSync compares the metadata of every file in the source and destination and compares them

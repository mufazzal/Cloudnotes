Elastic BeanStalk is the way to plant a seed for aws insfra and let it grow.
With EB, you can quickly deploy and manage applications in the AWS Cloud without having to learn about the infrastructure that runs those applications

EB supports applications developed in Go, Java, .NET, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby

You can interact with EB by using the 
	- EB console, 
	- AWS CLI
	- eb, a high-level CLI designed specifically for EB
	
	
Applicaion:-
	This is the logical collection of resources.
	When you create the Application AWS do not provision any resource rather its just sittimg empty logical unit.
	The application contains Enviorment App Version etc.
		
Application Version:-
	- This refers to a specific, labeled iteration of deployable code for a web application
	- It point to single S3 object that contains the deployable code, such as a Java WAR file
	- Applications can have many versions and each application version is unique

Environment:-
	- An environment is a collection of AWS resources running an application version.
	- AWS automatically provision resources when you create envirment 	
	- Each environment runs only one application version at a time
	- At a time you can have many environmentruning simultenousl and each having diffrent app version.
	
	Environment tier:-
		The environment tier designates the type of application that the environment runs, and determines what resources EB provisions to support it
		You have to chosse it when you create Env. it cannot be changed later.
		There is two type:
		1. Web server environment tier. 
		2. Worker environment tier.
	
	Platform:-
		A platform is a combination of an operating system, programming language runtime, web server, application server, and EB
		This are preconfigured by AWS and you can choose one from 
		Java, PHP, Node, .NEt, Docker etc.
		- You can create env and upload docker image to begin the infra
		
	Application Code:-
		You need to provide the soure code at a time of creatinf Env.
		You can provide Git, S3 or ZIP file as source code.
		
	Configuring Envioment:-
		Once the insfra is created after creatinf enviorment you can then also changes couple of item in theundeline AWS resources and Platforms
		AWS EB provides a wide range of options for customizing the resources in your environment, and EB behavior and platform settings
		You can change like, config of EC2, SG, LB, ASG etc.
		S3 bucket for code repository.
	
	Deployment:-
		You can deploy the latest code the EB via the EB console.
		It support Rolling, Rolling Batch, Blue/Green deployment.
	
	Configuration Changes:-
		When you modify configuration option settings in the Configuration section, EB propagates the change to all affected resources
		Many configuration changes can be applied to a running environment without replacing existing instances
		It type:-
			Rolling update, Immutable Update, 
		
	Env Monitoring:-
		You can monitor component in diffrent way
		Monitoring console: The EB specif panel for monitering
		Basic health reporting:	
		Manage alarms: You can create alarms for metrics that you are monitoring by using the Elastic Beanstalk console
		change history: You can use the AWS Management Console to view a history of configuration changes that have been made to your EB environments
											It uses cloudtrain to get it. it has date and time, IAM user, Tool, config param.
		Event and Notificatioon:
		Monitor instances:
		View instance logs:Logs are stored in S3 and also can be sent to CW.
		
		
											
--------		
	Web Server Enviorment:-
		Below are the item configured for Web Server Enviorment tier.
		EC2 instance: 
			Its default config is depends on the platfirm you choose. 
		Instance security group: 
			By default it open Inbound port 80 on HTTP and open all outbound
		Load balancer :
		Load balancer security group:-
			By default it open Inbound port 80 on HTTP and open all outbound
		Auto Scaling group:-
	
	Worker environments:-
		Below are the item configured for Worker Enviorment tier.
		All items in Web tier + SQS.
		
-----------

Permission:-
	see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts-roles-instance.html
	Service Role:-
		A service role is the IAM role that Elastic Beanstalk assumes when calling other services on your behalf
	instance profile:-
		An instance profile is an IAM role that is applied to instances launched in your Elastic Beanstalk environment.
		It must have some predefined permissions.
		
--------

Integrated AWS services:-
	Once the App and Env is initiated, the basic building block is ready now still you cann add below AWS services in the infra tack of EB.
	1. RDS
	2. DynamoDB
	3. ElastiCache
	4. EFS
	5. S3
	6. CW log and CW agent

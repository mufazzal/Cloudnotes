With the EC2 instance by default on EBS block witll be attached.
This is like an CPU with C-drive. you cannot simply remove it.

for linux system this drive moutned at : /dev/xvda

Though default you have one ESB attached but you can attach more then one.
You can attch them even after instance is running.

How ?
in nutshell-
first you create it
then you attcah it
then you create file system in it
then you mount it at some location.


Craeting the EBS: -
  You can create as many EBS as you wants via aws console. once created you can play with it like attaching/dettaching from EC2s.
  The EBS that you wants to attach must and must lie in same AZ as the EC2 lies. otherwise there will hell of throuhput.
  Come-on bro: How its id CPU lie in mumbai and C-drive in pune :).
  
  
  A. 
  Step to Creat EBS -
    1. AWS console > EC2 > Volume > Create
    2. Select type, Size 
    3. Select AZ, [remember AZ of EC2 and EBS must be same]
    4. Snapshot: if you wnats to create EBS from saved snapshot [will see later]
    5. Encryption: check it if u wants to encrypt or leave uncheck. if checked then provide the 'master key' too. 
        MAster KEy ????????
    6. Done
    
  B. 
  Creation is done
  Now attcah it
  1. AWS console > EC2 > Volume > 'Select you EBS' > Action > attach
  2. On the form select the instance id [you will see instances only from same AZ as of EBS]
  3. device ?????????????
  4. Done
  
  C.
  Attached to EC2 is done
  Now make it visible to the Operation System of EC2 [windows or linux]
  Ec2-linux and EBS connect-
  1. login to the EC2 via SSH. and do 'sudo su'
  2. command 'lsblk' > it will give the list of EBS attached [doesnt matter if mounted or not]
    Output - 
      xvda    202:0    0    8G  0 disk    
      └─xvda1 202:1    0    8G  0 part /   --> It means its is mounted at '/'
      xvdf    202:80   0  100G  0 disk     --> It means it attched EBS but not mounted. [The one we attched in step B.4]
  3. Before mounting also check if this EBS has a file system or not
      for this use command 
      > file -s /dev/xvdf
      if output is 'data' then its not a file system
      if not a file system then do it otherwise skip it
        3.1: run commnd 
          >  mkfs -t ext4 /dev/xvdf
              Here ext4-> is a type if file system
        3.2 verify if file system created again by same command 'file -s /dev/xvdf'
            if output is like 
              /dev/xvdf: Linux rev 1.0 ext4 filesystem data, ...... Then all good
        IMP: here 'lsblk' still give same result as step C.2, becoz the EBS now has a file system but yet not mounted.
        
   Now lets mount it->
  1.  go to home 'cd /'
  2. lets say you wants to mount at '/mufvolume' then create a directoru 'mufvolume' by 'mkdir mufvolume'
  3. Now mount by running command 
      >  mount dev/xvdf /mufvolume
  4. verify via 'lsblk'
    Output will be
        xvda    202:0    0    8G  0 disk
        └─xvda1 202:1    0    8G  0 part /
        xvdf    202:80   0  100G  0 disk /mufvolume      
 Now finally its mounted.
 
 Now ou can do many operation here like creating file/delete file etc.
 EG
  > cd /mufvolume   
  > echo 'HI MUF' > hi.txt
  > ls
  --> will create and give you a file with text in it
  ---------------
  Why we need it > 
    We need a extra EBS in many senario like if EC2 is a web server then you can use this directory to place frequently used images, media etc
  
  ---------------
  
  Now lets dettach it
  The safe way to detach the EBS is ti forst unmount it so lets see how unmount it  
  Unmounting it > 
      Simply run the command 
      > cd /
      > umount -d dev/xvdf 
  Unmount done now detach it
      go to 
      AWS console > EC2 > Volume > 'Select you EBS' > Action > de-attach
      Done
      
Deleting the EBS:-
  Up till now you have de-attach it but what if you wants to delete irt also. then there could be two scenario
    1. Your EBS do not have data that you wants to preserve for future. So go ahead delete it.
    2. Your EBS do have data that you wants to preserve for future. So dont delete righ away
        
    For case 2 the best thing is to take snapshot before deleting and recreate the same EBS with that snapshot later.
    
    
    How to create snapshot ->
      AWS console > EC2 > EBS > create snapshot 
      type name of snap shot  
      Done
      
   DEleting EBS:
    AWS console > EC2 > Volume > 'Select you EBS' > Action > delete
    Done
    
    Re-creating the EBS form snapshot- 
    Simply follow the steps to creat EBS and in step A.4 chose the snapshot you created before.
    Also this will have the preexisting file system in it so you can also skip all steps of filesystem creation
    once you mounted it over ant EC2 again you will be alse to see the file 'hi.txt' you created earlier as it is.
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    ----------------
    Q: what happen if you unmount or dettach the root EBS
    ??????

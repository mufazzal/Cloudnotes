With the EC2 instance by default on EBS block witll be attached.
This is like an CPU with C-drive. you cannot simply remove it.

for linux system this drive moutned at : /dev/xvda

Though default you have one ESB attached but you can attach more then one.
You can attch them even after instance is running.

How ?
in nutshell-
first you create it
then you attcah it
then you create file system in it
then you mount it at some location.


Craeting the EBS: -
  You can creat as many EBS as you wants via aws console. once created you can play with it like attaching/dettaching from EC2s.

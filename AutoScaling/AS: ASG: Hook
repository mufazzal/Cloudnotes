ASG also provide the lofecycle hook for launched and terminated instances. 
In ASG you can set the hook to trigger when any instance is launched or terminated. This trigger could be a SNS or SQS.
Whenver the ASG launch or terminate the instance the respective hook run. it send the message to SQS or SNS.
You can also use the Lambda as trugger but for this you have to use the Event-Bridge.

CFR for hook:-
  EC2LaunchHook: 
    Type: AWS::AutoScaling::LifecycleHook
    Properties: 
      AutoScalingGroupName: 
        Ref: ASG
      LifecycleTransition: "autoscaling:EC2_INSTANCE_LAUNCHING"
      NotificationTargetARN: 
        Ref: EC2WebsServerLaunchSNSTopic
      RoleARN: 
        Fn::GetAtt: 
          - ATSRoleForSNSAccess
          - Arn  

 ATSRoleForSNSAccess:
  This is the role created for ASG service(autoscaling.amazonaws.com) which give SNS:Publish permission of SNS topic. 

There is two hook one for launch and one fo terminating. 
When hook is running then at that time the instance is not in service state instaed it is in either Pending:Wait or Terminating:Wait state.

What happed if hook fail with some error, then u r given the two param to handle such failure.
    DefaultResult: "CONTINUE" OR "ABANDON"
    HeartbeatTimeout: 120
So if hook fail or hook take more then 120 second then the instance will
- continue to process in service sate if DefaultResult = CONTINUE
- discard the EC2 instance if DefaultResult = ABANDON

heartbeat timeout for:-
  You cas set this value so that instance remain in Wait state for that time and you get time to execute this hook.
  This time is diffrent from CoolDown time.
  If you are no finised in 'heartbeat timeout' then you can extend this time via 'record-lifecycle-action-heartbeat' command
  If you are doe earlier then you end the heartbeat timeout by 'complete-lifecycle-action' command

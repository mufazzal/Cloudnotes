ASG is very nicely integrated with ASG. 
You can set the ASG in a manner that the launched instances will fall behind the LB and automatically regiter in the Target Group of that LB.
You can also use the LB metrics like 'request count per' or other for scalling policy.
You can also use the ELB health check instead of EC2 health check for instance health.
You can use all three trype of LB with ASG.

State of LB:-
  When you attach the LB to the ASG. if first remain in 'Adding' state. once at least one EC2 is regitered and passed at least one of his Health Check, the LB goes in 'InService' state.
    
ASG Helth Check for LB:-
  By Default AG check the health of EC@ rather but not the Aplication hosted in it. You can change it to 'ELB' so that the ASG will check the helth of EC@ as well as via ELB.
  So any EC2 which is considered as UnHealthy by LB will also be considered as UnHealthy by ASG.


  AutoScalling and LB: 
    do not confuse the ASL with LB, the ASL is the feature that keep your capacity in check, depending in usage on each instance
      the ASL can kill/invoke the instances.
      For ASL it does not at all matter that what those instance are doing, from whome they are getting the requestes.
      The only thing they see if they are overloaded or underloaded then just kill/invoke few instances.
      
    The LB is the kind of balancer, when a new request comes to LB it check who has least task in its plate and assign the upcoming
      request to him. It will never be able to invoke/kill any instance.
      For LB it does not matter if system are heavily utilized, it will keep sending the requests to it subordinate EC2s even 
      all of them are at 99.99% occupied.

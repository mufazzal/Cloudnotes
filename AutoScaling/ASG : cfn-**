ASG is support the CreationPolicy and UpdatePolicy when created with cloudformation.

For ASG with CreationPolicy/UpdatePolicy + cfn-signal, you can control the deployment of update of ASG.

You can decide wheather the ASG deploy or update is successful or failed voa Cloudformation.

CreationPolicy:-

  ASGEC2:
    Type: 'AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup'
    CreationPolicy:
      ResourceSignal:
        Count: 3
        Timeout: PT15M  
    Properties:
      ....
Here the cloudformation will wait from three success signal before considering it a success.
IF any unsuccessful signal is recive instead then the stack deployment will be failed
It will wait max 15 minutes for 3 signal. otherwise a fail will be consider.

How to send the signal:-
  You can sent it via aws-sdk, api, cli etc.
  to send it fron instance use
      sudo /opt/aws/bin/cfn-signal \
          -s true \
          --stack Def-Prefix-App1ATSGroupECS \
          --resource ASGEC2 \
          --region us-east-1  
          
 UpdatePolicy:-
  For ASG it will definehow the new instances will be roll out wih new seting in the ASG. This will update terminate and lauchyhe new instance with new setting.
  
    UpdatePolicy:
      AutoScalingScheduledAction:
        IgnoreUnmodifiedGroupSizeProperties: 'true'
      AutoScalingRollingUpdate:
        MinInstancesInService: MFR:State:rollUpdateMinInstancesInService
        MaxBatchSize: MFR:State:rollUpdateMaxBatchSize
        PauseTime: PT1M
        WaitOnResourceSignals: 'true' 
    
    UpdatePolicy.AutoScalingScheduledAction: 
      Define weather to honour or ignore any schedule action event to lauch ot terminate the instance during the update.
    UpdatePolicy.AutoScalingRollingUpdate:
      If the updates required to launch the new instances and terminate the older one, This filed will define how to proceed with it.
      Like you wants to roll then in batches or at once.
      As name suggest MinInstancesInService and MaxBatchSize define how many instance will remain in serviceand how many will be in update at time.
      WaitOnResourceSignals define if the ASG should wait for success signals and max time for wait is PT1M
    UpdatePolicy.AutoScalingReplacingUpdate   
      It define if the replacement is needed then wheather it should replace the ASG + Instances or Instances only.
      If true then it will replace the ASG as well
      
      
    UpdatePolicy.AutoScalingReplacingUpdate:

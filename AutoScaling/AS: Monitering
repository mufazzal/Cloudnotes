Intance Health Check:-
ASG can determine the health status of an instance using one or more of the following:
  - Status checks provided by Amazon EC2 to identify hardware and software issues that may impair an instance. 
    The default health checks for an Auto Scaling group are EC2 status checks only.
  - Health checks provided by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). These health checks are disabled by default but can be enabled.
    Instances for groups that use ELB health checks are considered healthy if they are in the running state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer
  - Your custom health checks.
  
Initial Health Check flow:-
  > Scalling Policy dictate the Capacity increase
  > ASG launch the new instances
  > If LB is also selected then instance also regitered in the target.
  > Health check grace priode start now
  > If Health chech type is EC2 then ASG will chekh instance health till 
  > If Health chech type is ELB then ASG will chekh instance and Load balacner health chech both.
  > Idily you Grace priode elapse when this health check produce result
  > if in the Grace priode health check passed then the instance comes in 'InService'
  > if in the Grace priode health check failed then the instance replaced with new
  > if in the Grace priode elapse then the instance replaced with new
  
  
Health check grace period:-
  This is applicabe for ELB and EC2 both kind of Health Check.
  HealthCheckGracePeriod for the ASG to determine how long to wait before checking the health status of the instance.  
  ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application, from when an instance comes into service to when it can receive traffic. 
  If you add a lifecycle hook, the grace period does not start until the lifecycle hook actions are completed and the instance enters the InService state

Health Check of EC2:-
  Simply you can see it in console.

Health Check of EC2 By LB:-
  The Target group of LB have param name 'HealthCheckPath', here you can set the relatve url for health check.
  The LB will look for <subordinate EC2 private IP>/HealthCheckPath.html for health of EC2.

Health Check of EC2 By ASG:-
  There is two way to do this
    1. If EC2 and ASG is not behind LB
      Simply check if instance in in running stage. [this will not check if Application inthe instance is also ok]
    2. If EC2 and ASG is behind LB
      First check if instance is running or not 
      if yes then
        Asn LB to do the Health chech for that EC2 to verify is Application is also healthy.

ASG and CW:-
  ASG publish many CW metrics FREE in 1-Minut granularity.
  Below are some ASG mterices
    GroupDesiredCapacity, GroupInServiceInstances, GroupPendingInstances, GroupTotalInstances etc.
    GroupInServiceCapacity, GroupStandbyCapacity
    StatusCheckFailed, StatusCheckFailed_Instance etc.
  Below are the dimentions:-
    AutoScalingGroupName 

---------------  
Special Case og EC2 intance Health = Impaired:-
  In this case Instance is not trmibated instead it was given some time to get recover from it.

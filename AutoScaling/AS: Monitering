Intance Health Check:-
ASG can determine the health status of an instance using one or more of the following:
  - Status checks provided by Amazon EC2 to identify hardware and software issues that may impair an instance. 
    The default health checks for an Auto Scaling group are EC2 status checks only.
  - Health checks provided by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). These health checks are disabled by default but can be enabled.
    Instances for groups that use ELB health checks are considered healthy if they are in the running state and they are reported as healthy by the load balancer
  - Your custom health checks.
  
Initial Health Check flow:-
  > Scalling Policy dictate the Capacity increase
  > ASG launch the new instances
  > If LB is also selected then instance also regitered in the target.
  > Health check grace priode start now
  > If Health chech type is EC2 then ASG will chekh instance health till 
  > If Health chech type is ELB then ASG will chekh instance and Load balacner health chech both.
  > Idily you Grace priode elapse when this health check produce result
  > if in the Grace priode health check passed then the instance comes in 'InService'
  > if in the Grace priode health check failed then the instance replaced with new
  > if in the Grace priode elapse then the instance replaced with new
  
  
Health check grace period:-
  This is applicabe for ELB and EC2 both kind of Health Check.
  HealthCheckGracePeriod for the ASG to determine how long to wait before checking the health status of the instance.  
  ensure that the health check grace period covers the expected startup time for your application, from when an instance comes into service to when it can receive traffic. 
  If you add a lifecycle hook, the grace period does not start until the lifecycle hook actions are completed and the instance enters the InService state
  
  
  
ASG and CW:-
  ASG publish many CW metrics FREE in 1-Minut granularity.
  Below are some ASG mterices
    GroupDesiredCapacity, GroupInServiceInstances, GroupPendingInstances, GroupTotalInstances etc.
    GroupInServiceCapacity, GroupStandbyCapacity
    StatusCheckFailed, StatusCheckFailed_Instance etc.

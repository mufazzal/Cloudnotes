A buildspec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. 
You can 
  > include a buildspec as part of the source code or 
  > you can define a buildspec when you create a build project or
  > you can define a buildspec when you run a build project 
  
- If you include a buildspec as part of the source code, by default, the buildspec file must be named buildspec.yml and placed in the root of your source directory
- Use a different buildspec file for different builds in the same repository, such as buildspec_debug.yml and buildspec_release.yml.

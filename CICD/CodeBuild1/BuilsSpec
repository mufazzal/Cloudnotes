A buildspec is a collection of build commands and related settings, in YAML format, that CodeBuild uses to run a build. 
You can 
  > include a buildspec as part of the source code or 
  > you can define a buildspec when you create a build project or
  > you can define a buildspec when you run a build project 
  
- If you include a buildspec as part of the source code, by default, the buildspec file must be named buildspec.yml and placed in the root of your source directory
- Use a different buildspec file for different builds in the same repository, such as buildspec_debug.yml and buildspec_release.yml.

Setting Enviorment variable in buildspec:-
  env:
    variables:
      App1EnvVar1: "value of App1EnvVar1"
    parameter-store:
      App1ParamStore1: /app1/dev/app1ParamStore1
      App1ParamStoreSecret1: /app1/dev/app1ParamStoreSecret1
    secrets-manager:
      App1Secret1: "App1Secrets:App1SecretKey1"
      App1Secret2: "App1Secrets:App1SecretKey2"

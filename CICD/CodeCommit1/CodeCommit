Migrating to CodeCommit:-
  You can migrate a Git repository to a CodeCommit repository in a number of ways
    - By Cloning
    - By Mirroring
    - By cloning some or all branches
  You can migrate to CodeCommit from other version control systems, such as Perforce, Subversion, or TFS, but you must first migrate to Git.
  
  Git to CodeCommit Repo:-
    1. Create a CodeCommit repository if not exist
    2. Now go to any directory in local computer by
          cd <dir_path>
    3. Run one of below command
        This will bring all the repo branches and filed in that in the local folder
        if you do not use mirror then this will be a GIT directory connected to GIT repo [with .git folder]. but we wants to create the CodeComit repo so use mirror.         
        git clone --mirror https://github.com/<name of repo in git> <folder_name>
    4. now go into the repo folder  cd <folder_name> 
    5 push the chages with  all the brach with --all option
        git push https://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<codecommit_repo_name> --all
      
  Local Folder to CodeComit:-
    1. Create a CodeCommit repository if not exist
    2. Now go to any directory in local computer by
          cd <dir_path>
    3. Configure git to use the "main" as default name for brach [because codecommit use main as default name not other]
        git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    4. run below command
        git init
       Now its a git repo.
       commit the change
        git commit â€“m "Initial commit"
    5 push the chages with --all option
        git push https://git-codecommit.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/v1/repos/<codecommit_repo_name> --all

CodeCommit and Elastic BeanStalk:-
  CodeCommit is tightly integrated with EB. You can deploy the changes in source code directly to the EB from Codecommit via some command.
  It will deploy only changes rather then full project. So it save lot of time and internet bandwith.
  
----------
Encryption:-
  For CodeCommit, the data is automatically encrypted at rest and in transit by KMS key.

Migrating to CodeCommit:-
  You can migrate a Git repository to a CodeCommit repository in a number of ways
    - By Cloning
    - By Mirroring
    - By cloning some or all branches
  You can migrate to CodeCommit from other version control systems, such as Perforce, Subversion, or TFS, but you must first migrate to Git.

CodeCommit and Elastic BeanStalk:-
  CodeCommit is tightly integrated with EB. You can deploy the changes in source code directly to the EB from Codecommit via some command.
  It will deploy only changes rather then full project. So it save lot of time and internet bandwith.
  
----------
Encryption:-
  For CodeCommit, the data is automatically encrypted at rest and in transit by KMS key.

Deployment on the LAmbda is bit tricky.
Here you do not actully push the code of lambda via the codeploy instead you alredy have lambda version deployed and 
you simply mangae the traffic shifting from old lambda version to new lambda version.

Deployment group:-
  The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment.    

Deployment group > Deployment Type:-
  Lambda Support only Blue/Green. So no choice here forthis. 
  
Deployment Group > Environment configuration:
  No setting in here. LAmbda do not use this setting.  

Deployment group > Deployment Setting/Configuration:-
  It define how the traffic will be shifted to new Lambda version. Possible value:
    carany: Traffic shifted from older to new in two itration.  Eg. LambdaCanary<X>percentIn<Y>Minute
    linear: Traffic shifted from older to new in multiple with lineat time delay itration. Eg. LambdaLinear<X>percentIn<Y>Minute
    none: traffic shifted in one iteration only. LambdaAllAtOnce

Deployment group > Load Balancer:-
  No setting in here. LAmbda do not use this setting.  

------------------------------------

Lambda Appspec file:-
  Below is how its look, You have to provide it at a time of deployment. Its not part of deployment Group.
    Resources:
      - myLambdaFunction:
          Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
          Properties:
            Name: "myLambdaFunction"
            Alias: "myLambdaFunctionAlias"
            CurrentVersion: "1"
            TargetVersion: "2"
    Hooks:
      - BeforeAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateBeforeTrafficShift"
      - AfterAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateAfterTrafficShift"    

    This will shift the traffic from CurrentVersion(1) to TargetVersion(2) in the manner defined in the sected deployment Group.
    hook:-
      This is the lambda that will trigger before and after traffic shifted to new versions
    Alias:
      New version will be mapped to this Alias. if alias not exist then it will be created first.
  

-----------------------------------------------

Deplyment of lambda codedeploy + SAM:-
  CodeBuild + SAM + CodeDeploy for better system.
  In CodeDeploy you set values via SAM template 'DeploymentPreference' in 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
  This are:-
    AutoPublishAlias 
    DeploymentPreference 
    Hooks

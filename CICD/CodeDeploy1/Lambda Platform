Deployment group:-
  The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment.    

Deployment group > Deployment Type:-
  Lambda Support only Blue/Green. So no choice here forthis. 
  
Deployment Group > Environment configuration:
  No setting in here. LAmbda do not use this setting.  

Deployment group > Deployment Setting/Configuration:-
  It define how the traffic will be shifted to new Lambda version. Possible value:
    carany: Traffic shifted from older to new in two itration.  Eg. LambdaCanary<X>percentIn<Y>Minute
    linear: Traffic shifted from older to new in multiple with lineat time delay itration. Eg. LambdaLinear<X>percentIn<Y>Minute
    none: traffic shifted in one iteration only. 

Deployment group > Load Balancer:-
  No setting in here. LAmbda do not use this setting.  

------------------------------------

Lambda Appspec file:-
  Below is how its look, You have to provide it at a time of deployment. Its not part of deployment Group.
    Resources:
      - myLambdaFunction:
          Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
          Properties:
            Name: "myLambdaFunction"
            Alias: "myLambdaFunctionAlias"
            CurrentVersion: "1"
            TargetVersion: "2"
    Hooks:
      - BeforeAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateBeforeTrafficShift"
      - AfterAllowTraffic: "LambdaFunctionToValidateAfterTrafficShift"    

    This will shift the traffic from CurrentVersion(1) to TargetVersion(2) in the manner defined in the sected deployment Group.
    hook:-
      This is the lambda that will trigger before and after traffic shifted to new versions
    Alias:
      New version will be mapped to this Alias. if alias not exist then it will be created first.

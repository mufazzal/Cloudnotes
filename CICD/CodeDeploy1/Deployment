Now we will see how to cteate a deployment. You can do it via Console or CLI.

To Create a Deployment most of the thing to do is same across all the Application-platform.

Below are the common steps:-
  1. Select the Application created in CodeDEploy on which you wants deployment
  2. Select the deployment group with wich yoy wants deployment.
  3. Revision:  
        This contain the information about new version of application and how to deploy it.
        Its configuration is Platform dependent.
  4. Override 'DeploymentGroup > Deployment Setting/Configuration' of Deployment group.
        This is also platform dependednt like
        you can change 'AllAtOce' to 'OneAtATime' for EC2
        you can change 'ECSAllAtOce' to 'ECSLinear10PercentEvery5Minute' for ECS.        
  5. Override 'DeploymentGroup > Rollback' setting of Deployment group. 
  
  Revision:
    For EC2:-
      Here the revision is the artifact that contain AppSpec file at root with all theother dependencis. EG:-
      This is the zip file whose strucure shouls look like this [but not neccessary]
      MuBundle.zip
        |--- AppSpec.yml    MUST
        |----Config         NAme could change, this is the folder of config files
        |----Scripts        NAme could change, this is the folder of scripts
        |----Source         NAme could change, this is the folder of source code.
      You must set:
        Revison Type: Git or S3
        If its S3 then give S3 url of file
        if its Git then give git token and url of file.
        
    For ECS:-
      For ECS you must provide
        - Either a single Appspec file(json or yaml formatted) location 
        - or a zip file location containing this file only
        - or provide content for Appspec directly at a time of deployment creation.
      You must set:
        Revison Type: S3 or Write in Editor
        If its S3 then give S3 url of file
        If its  'Write in Editor' then write the conte nt there.
        
    For Lambda:-
      For ECS you must provide
        - Either a single Appspec file(json or yaml formatted) location 
        - or a zip file location containing this file only
        - or provide content for Appspec directly at a time of deployment creation.
      You must set:
        Revison Type: S3 or Write in Editor
        If its S3 then give S3 url of file
        If its  'Write in Editor' then write the conte nt there.

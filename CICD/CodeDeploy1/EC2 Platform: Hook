This has info about the scripts that should be ran on some specific time of deploument lifecycle.
The sequence of hook always remain same bur some of the hook may or may not be called depending upon what config the dep has.
The dep may happen one or more than one EC2. this lifecycle run for each of this EC2 and completely independent of each other. 
Below is the list of hook with time when its called.
> before and after the traffic blocked from LB
    BeforeBlockTraffic, AfterBlockTraffic:
      Both on this event fire only and only if The candidate EC2 is attached to any Load Balancer

> Hook for stopping the application
    ApplicationStop: 
      CpdeDeploy do not know how he should stop the running application. 
      In this hook you provide the script to stop it. for EG. to stop apache server use 'stop server httpd'
      In this hook you should stop any process that you deemed to be necessary

  > Hook for new Installation time
    BeforeInstall, AfterInstall:
      This two hook provide event before and after installation. you can use this event in install any necessary
      dependecy in the EC2. EG. to run a node server EC2 must need to have node installed. So put node install
      script in 'BeforeInstall'

> Hook for strating the application
    ApplicationStart:
      CpdeDeploy do not know how he should start the application. 
      In this hook you provide the script to start it. for EG. to stop apache server use 'start server httpd' and for node app you give 'node src/server.js'
      In this hook you should start any process that you deemed to be necessary                               

 > Hook for validation of installation
    ValidateService:
      This hook is very good to test if installtion is proper or not for eg. you can tset here if node is installed 
      or not or check if some process is running or not or check if some file is there or not.

 > before and after the traffic allowed from LB
    BeforeAllowTraffic, AfterAllowTraffic:
      Both on this event fire only and only if The candidate EC2 is attached to any Load Balancer

 >>> Note : There is four more hook but they are not available for override. so unusable for now
        DownloadBundle, install, AllowTraffic, BlockTraffic

Hook Lifecycle for diffrent scenario:-
   se 1: For In-place : EC2 : without any loadbalancer
            ApplicationStop
            BeforeInstall
            AfetrInstall
            ApplicationStart
            validateService
    se 2:  For In-place : EC2 : with loadbalancer
            BeforeBlockTraffic
            AfterBlockTraffic
            ApplicationStop
            BeforeInstall
            AfetrInstall
            ApplicationStart
            validateService
            BeforeAllowTraffic
            AfterAllowTraffic

    se 3:  For BG : EC2 : without any loadbalancer
          Impossible, For BG you must have LB.
    se 4:  For BG : EC2 : with loadbalancer
         on older instances
              BeforeBlockTraffic
              AfterBlockTraffic
         on newer instances
              ApplicationStop
              BeforeInstall
              AfetrInstall
              ApplicationStart
              validateService
              BeforeAllowTraffic
              AfterAllowTraffic

Hook Script File:-
  The script in hook file do couple of operation at time that hook run. This is how it shoul look like generall
  laets say you want to run somthing at BeforeInstall then
  in appspec.yml
    BeforeInstall: 
      - scripts/BeforeInstall.sh

  in scripts/BeforeInstall.sh
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "I am in BeforeInstall"

  This first line in this file will be the Shebang,  which tells the systen in which enviorment this file should ran.
  for Bourne shell envirment       #!/bin/sh
  for Bash envirment               #!/bin/bash
  for python envirment             !/usr/bin/env python
  for node envirment               !/usr/bin/env node

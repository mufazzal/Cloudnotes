Think of Dep Group as reusable deployment comfiguratiuion template which contain lot of config detail like, dep type, enviorment, 
sucsses stratagy, LB detail, EC2 groups or tag, ASG etc.
Once you created dep group with all this infor you can then for deployment you give two things
  1. The grouo that you wants to use
  2. The deployment bundle location 
  
hThe configuration set up of deployment group is Platform dependent.
You will need diffrent field to set for diffrent platform
EG: 
  For paltform EC2, you need to set ASG or EC2 tags
  For ECS, You must set ECS service and cluster etc.
  
For platform specific setting see the respected files for platform. 

There are some common param across all the platform yoou must set. See below for detail:-

Name:-
  You must give name to depg. 

Service Role:-
  The service role must carry all neccesary permission for operations.
  AWS provide ready to use policies for this. YOu can create role and attach them
  For EC2     : AWSCodeDeployRole 
  For ECS     : AWSCodeDeployRoleForECS or AWSCodeDeployRoleForECSLimited
  For Lambda  : AWSCodeDeployRoleForLambda or AWSCodeDeployRoleForLambdaLimited 


Triggers:-
  This also provide the way to trigger some functionality on CodeDEploy state change but here it only support SNS.
  You get the trigger for below state change
    Deployment start/fail/ready/rollback etc.
    intance start/stop etc.


Automatic RollBack:-
  In deployment group configuration you can set if you wants to have automatic roll back enabled or not.
  If its not enabled then any fail deployment will be remain as it is and app goes offline. You have to go and manually roll it back.
  You can set diifrent event(multiple) for starting roll back
  1. Any deployment fail:-
      If deployment failed on any stage of any instamce then the rollback will be started on all the instances.
  2. On certain CW alarm:-
      Even if all the deployment succed then you can stil set an CW alalrm. and if that alarm goes red the deployment will be rollded back.
      This ios useful if say new version of code causing the 90% of CPU usage
  3. Disable Rollback:-
      Do not roll back if deployment failed.  
  > In automated rollback codedeploy simply do the re-deployment of last know working app version. You do not have to do any thing.

Deployment group:-
  The deployment group contains settings and configurations used during the deployment.
  - It will have common setting of depg used for all compute platform like Roolback, alarm etc.
  
    

Deployment group > Deployment Type:-
  There are two type for EC2 platform
    1. In-Place:  
        In this kind of deployment the application is installed on existing running instances. they will be brifly taken offline
        then dettached from the LB (if any)
        then upgraded with new version 
        then attached to LB(if any) again
        and then finally started ahain
        This has couple of risk
          1. It take the instances offline so capacity is reduced
          2. roll back is difficult you have to re-deploy the older version once again
          Actully it is rarle user, it use only for the first time deployment.
    2. Blue Green  
          This pne is most widely user Deployment. This has certain featurewhich make it very reliable and practical to use.
          Why ?
            Because 2 risk of In-Place deployment mentioned above
          What is neccessary for BG?
            The candidate EC2 must be attached to the LB. if not then you cannot do the BG.
          How it work:
            Unlike in In-place wherein the upgraded app is deployed over same EC2. in BG 
            completely new EC2 instances will be Used or Created [depending on 'Environment configuration' user choose] for each candidate instance 
            and then 
            upgraded app is deployed over the new instances 
            and then
            all newly instances will be attached to LB (LB is must for BG)
            and then
            for sometime all the instances (old + new) will be subordinated to the LB
            and after some time [user can configure this time for sanity]
            the older one will be dettached from LB
            and then
            they older one will be terminated.
            
            So in nutshell you create the new instances and attach it to LB and kill older one.
            
          Advantages:-
            1. Reverting deployment way too easy. just attch the old EC2 with LB
            2. No capacity reduction 
          
          How New Instances are Created or Used:-
            There is two way for the new instance
            1. Use existing one:-
                The developer creat a instances MANUALLY and at the time of deployment he will give info about either its tag or ASG
                This is rarely used because it add the overhead task of creating the EC2 manually.
            2. Let Codedeploy create for you:-
                For this you must have the ASG. without ASG it will not work.
                Here you will give information about the ASG in deployment group. 
                later at the time of deployment the codedeploy agent will create a copy of that ASG with exactly same cofiguration 
                and create new instances in that ASG for you. then use those new instances foe new version and kill the older ones.
                This one is widely used. here you hjust have to set the proper ASG and codedeploy will do the rest.

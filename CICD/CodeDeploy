Deployment Bundle:-
    This is the zip file whose strucure shouls look like this [but not neccessary]
    MuBundle.zip
      |--- AppSpec.yml    MUST
      |----Config         NAme could change, this is the folder of config files
      |----Scripts        NAme could change, this is the folder of scripts
      |----Source         NAme could change, this is the folder of source code.
    This look of zip is very primitive it can have some more files in it.  
      

 
     7. Now finally Create deployment
        7.1  AWS > CodeDEploy > Deploy > Application > MufCodeDeploy > Create Deployment
        7.2  Select the deployment group created in step 6
        7.3  select thee source from S3 bucket and choose the bundle you uploaded to s3 
        Now you can see thst deployment is started and in aws cosole you can see its process.
     Done        
    So here the process is finished.
    
    SO notice here that 
    - The deployment group created in step 6 is reusable. if you created once then you can resue it again for next version of deployment
    - Step 7 is one time activity. you create a deployment and run it once for next release you have to re-create one more deployment.

 Manual Rollback:-
  Simply run a new deployment with previous working version

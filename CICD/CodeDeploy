Why wwe need it :-
  Say you have a EC2s running on version1 of code and nw you wants to upgrade the version to next
  What you will do
  1. you have to stop the App or stop the EC2 if it is Blue/Greem deployment
  2. Now also ou have to configure the LB(if any) to not to sent traffic to in-deployment Ec2s
  2. now you have to login to instances of EC2 with proper user
  3. Now you have to upload the new code 
  4. Now you have to make chages in the configuration if needed and run some script if needed.
  5. Now you have start the App.
  6. Now you may also run a script for health check
  
The code deploy help the user to automate the above process of deploying. 
Here you have to provide 
  The Source: The location of 'Artifact' on S3 or github or other
    Inside the artifat lies
      1. The new Code
      2. Appspec.yml file.
      3. Scripts that you wants to run at events of deployment life cycle
  The Destination: Wher you wants to deploy, 
    1. EC2/On-Premise
        - On EC2s of specific tags
        - On a Autoscalling group of EC2
        - On premise instances.
    2. Lambda
      ???????????????
    3. ECS
    
 CodeDeploy is so smart that even if your EC2 is attached with any LB, 
 for in-place deployment it will go to that LB and instruct them to not to send any request to in-deploment EC2. and once done it again go to that LB and give him a green signal.
 If it is Blue/Green deployment then it will make sure to that the new instances are invoked and lated older one are killed.
      
      
 VVIMP: Code deploy automate the steps of deploment in the EC2/LEmbda But it not at all automate the deployment if a new artifact 
        come in the source location. For this you have to use the CodePipeline.
      
      
      
Some component of CodeDeploy ->

  #INSTCODEAG
  CodeDeploy Agent:- 
    if you wants to deploy the code with codedeply on EC2 you have to install the 'CodeDeploAgent' on EC2 instance.
    THis is one time activity for EC2. once it is installed you will be able to use the CodeDeploy for automation.
    Usually you should install it when you start a EC2 instance. Provide the proper script in the start script of EC2
    Script for installing CodeDeployAgent:-  
        go to https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/codedeploy-agent-launch-configuration/
        copy script and paste it in user data.
  
  How Codedeploy find the exact EC2's to deploy code on:-
    There is two possibility
    1. By Tags: In the CodeDeploy at the time of creating Deployment you can provide the specific tag. 
        Now CodeDeploy will find all the EC2(More than one possible) that has the same tag and deploy the new version on it.
    2. By Autoscalling Group: If you are using the autoscalling and so your instances invoked/killd based on usage. 
    
    
  AppSpec File:- 
    This is the file that must lie at the root of the zip file of you code.
    This has all the configuration related information for for deployment
    It has 4 parts:-
      1. Version : always 0.0, will be used in future
      2. OS: supported OS
      3. Files: 
        this has info of list of file that should be copid to destination. it has two piece of info
          - The file to be copied from
          - the should be copied to.
           EG:
              - source: /DepTest/
                destination: /MufProject/DepTest
          This will copy all the content inside the folder 'DepTest/' in the zipped bundle to the '/MufProject/DepTest' of EC2 instance
              - source: /Resources/
                destination: /MufProject/Resources          
          This will copy all the content inside the folder 'Resources/' in the zipped bundle to the '/MufProject/Resources' of EC2 instance
        So you can specify as many pair you wants here.  
          
      4. Hooks: 
        This has info about the scripts that should be ran on some specific time of deploument lifecycle.
        The sequence of hook always remain same bur some of the hook may or may not be called depending upon what config the dep has.
        The dep may happen one or more than one EC2. this lifecycle run for each of this EC2 and completely independent of each other. 
        Below is the list of hook with time when its called.
        
        > before and after the traffic blocked from LB
            BeforeBlockTraffic
            AfterBlockTraffic
                                  : Both on this event fire only and only if The candidate EC2 is attached to any Load Balancer
                                  
        > Hook for stopping the application
            ApplicationStop
                                  : CpdeDeploy do not know how he should stop the running application. 
                                    In this hook you provide the script to stop it. for EG. to stop apache server use 'stop server httpd'
                                    In this hook you should stop any process that you deemed to be necessary
         
          > Hook for new Installation time
            BeforeInstall
            AfterInstall
                                  : This two hook provide event before and after installation. you can use this event in install any necessary
                                    dependecy in the EC2. EG. to run a node server EC2 must need to have node installed. So put node install
                                    script in 'BeforeInstall'
                                    
        > Hook for strating the application
            ApplicationStart
                                  : CpdeDeploy do not know how he should start the application. 
                                    In this hook you provide the script to start it. for EG. to stop apache server use 'start server httpd'
                                    and for node app you give 'node src/server.js'
                                    In this hook you should start any process that you deemed to be necessary                                    
         > Hook for validation of installation
            ValidateService
                                  : This hook is very good to test if installtion is proper or not for eg. you can tset here if node is installed 
                                    or not or check if some process is running or not or check if some file is there or not.
         
         > before and after the traffic allowed from LB
            BeforeAllowTraffic
            AfterAllowTraffic
                                  : Both on this event fire only and only if The candidate EC2 is attached to any Load Balancer
         
         >>> Note : There is four more hook but they are not available for override. so unusable for now
                DownloadBundle, install, AllowTraffic, BlockTraffic
         
         
         The final sequence ->
         
            BeforeBlockTraffic  --->    [BlockTraffic]    --->    AfterBlockTraffic   ---->>---|          IF LB is attached to candidate EC2 then this three will be called otherwise not

     Flow of the hook will remail same for always but some hook may or may not be called.
     
     Calling mechanism fo BG :-
      For BG deplloyment there is a patch. that is 
      in the In-Place the app is installed in same EC2 and so EC2 remain there and hooks are called over those EC2.
      But in BG its bit tricky
      new EC2 are created from ASG, those are attached to LB and the older EC2 are dettached fron LB.
      So its obvious that hooks of the lifecycle will be called over the respective EC2 only
      for EG:
        The older instaces will be deattached but app wont be installed on older and it also not be re-attached to LB
        so on the older instaces only this hook will be called
                BeforeBlockTraffic
                AfterBlockTraffic
        The newer one not be attached to LB initialy but app will be installed on newer one and it also re-attached to LB 
        so on the newer instaces only this hook will be called
          ApplicationStop
                BeforeInstall
                AfetrInstall
                ApplicationStart
                validateService
                BeforeAllowTraffic
                AfterAllowTraffic
      
    
    Verified Scenarios
       se 1: For In-place : EC2 : without any loadbalancer
                ApplicationStop
                BeforeInstall
                AfetrInstall
                ApplicationStart
                validateService
        se 2:  For In-place : EC2 : with loadbalancer
                BeforeBlockTraffic
                AfterBlockTraffic
                ApplicationStop
                BeforeInstall

                AfterAllowTraffic
                
        se 3:  For BG : EC2 : without any loadbalancer
              Impossible, For BG you must have LB.
        se 4:  For BG : EC2 : with loadbalancer
             on older instances
                  BeforeBlockTraffic
                  AfterBlockTraffic
             on newer instances
                  ApplicationStop
                  BeforeInstall
                  AfetrInstall
                  ApplicationStart

                  AfterAllowTraffic


  What happeen in BG deployment if it is for the first time and so no plder instances exist?
  In that case some of the steps like blockTraffic and kill instance will not be called. 
  But new ASG will be created and new instances will be launched in that. So for first time deployment is also fine with BG
---------------------

Role of EC2-Tag, ASG, LB:-
  In th Codedeploy The EC2-Tag and ASG help the agent to finding out which EC2 he need to work upon. 
  The devops engineer do have to provice at least one of this information in step 6.5
  This has nothing to do with LB.
  Devops engineer have option either to specify the LB in step 6.7. 
  If he specify-
    For In-Place and BG both:-
       Then as discussed the deattach and attach of LB and EC2 take place on deployment Lifecycle
  If he do not:-
    For In-Place:-
        THen all the time of deployment the LB keep sending the traffic to EC2.
    For BG:-
        For BG it is must. BG is impposible without LB. you have to specify the LB if you are doiing BG deploynet.


   Auto Scalling Group, Load-Balancer-Target-Group and BG deployment:-
    Do not confuse.
    The CodeDeploy first go to ASG to find which are the candidate instances. All the instances in that invoked by this ASG are candidate.
    Now codedeploy go to LB(you provided in step ??) and get the Load-Balancer-Target-Group of that LB
    Now from Load-Balancer-Target-Group he determine which instances are subordinate of LB.
      In general both the list of EC2 one from ASG and one of those subordinate to LB are same.
      lets assume its same.
    Now Codedeploy will create a copy of ASG as ASG_2 with 100% same configuration
    Now launch instances in new ASG
    Now add the new instances to Load-Balancer-Target-Group and so newly craeted instances also subordinated to LB
    later suspend the ASG (the older one not the copied)
    then remove the old instances from Load-Balancer-Target-Group and so only newly craeted instances remain subordinated to LB

    Hook Script File:-
      The script in hook file do couple of operation at time that hook run. This is how it shoul look like generall
      laets say you want to run somthing at BeforeInstall then
      in appspec.yml
        BeforeInstall: 
          - scripts/BeforeInstall.sh
          
      in scripts/BeforeInstall.sh
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "I am in BeforeInstall"
      
      This first line in this file will be the Shebang,  which tells the systen in which enviorment this file should ran.
      for Bourne shell envirment       #!/bin/sh
      for Bash envirment               #!/bin/bash
      for python envirment             !/usr/bin/env python
      for node envirment               !/usr/bin/env node
      
------------------
 
CodeDEploy and design hook for Node App
  1. in BeforeInstall hook install the nodejs via 
                          #!/bin/bash
                          echo "I am in BeforeInstall" >> 'home/ec2-user/mmmll.txt'
                          curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
                          . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
                          nvm install node
                          echo "	Node Version installed: $(node -v)" >> 'home/ec2-user/mmmll.txt'  
  2. in ApplicationStart Hook give
                          node /MufProject/DepTest/src/main.js
                          echo "	Your App is running at: $(sudo ss -tulpn | grep :3000)" >> 'home/ec2-user/mmmll.txt'  
         [Though command in ApplicationStart not working fine fioe now. why ??????????????????]                 
                          
------------------
Deployment Bundle:-
    This is the zip file whose strucure shouls look like this [but not neccessary]
    MuBundle.zip
      |--- AppSpec.yml    MUST
      |----Config         NAme could change, this is the folder of config files
      |----Scripts        NAme could change, this is the folder of scripts
      |----Source         NAme could change, this is the folder of source code.
    This look of zip is very primitive it can have some more files in it.  
      
      
  IAM Roles:-
    - You must create one Role for 'CodeDEploy' with policy ??????? attached. This role will grant the CodeDeploy to perform operation such as
        start EC2, terminate EC2, attache EC2 for LB, dettache it etc.
    - IF your code is on S3 then you must give EC2 the access of S3. So you should have a role with S3FullAccess policy attached to EC2
  So depending on this you should create two Role one for EC2(if you are usin S3) and one for CodeDeploy(Must)  
    
  
  Deployment Type:-
    There are two type
    1. In-Place:  
        In this kind of deployment the application is installed on existing running instances. they will be brifly taken offline
        then dettached from the LB (if any)
        then upgraded with new version 
        then attached to LB(if any) again
        and then finally started ahain
        This has couple of risk
          1. It take the instances offline so capacity is reduced
          2. roll back is difficult you have to re-deploy the older version once again
          Actully it is rarle user, it use only for the first time deployment.
    2. Blue Green  
          This pne is most widely user Deployment. This has certain featurewhich make it very reliable and practical to use.
          Why ?
            Because 2 risk of In-Place deployment mentioned above
          What is neccessary for BG?
            The candidate EC2 must be attached to the LB. if not then you cannot do the BG.
          How it work:
            Unlike in In-place wherein the upgraded app is deployed over same EC2. in BG 
            completely new EC2 instances will be Used or Created [depending on 'Environment configuration' user choose] for each candidate instance 
            and then 
            upgraded app is deployed over the new instances 
            and then
            all newly instances will be attached to LB (LB is must for BG)
            and then
            for sometime all the instances (old + new) will be subordinated to the LB
            and after some time [user can configure this time for sanity]
            the older one will be dettached from LB
            and then
            they older one will be terminated.
            
            So in nutshell you create the new instances and attach it to LB and kill older one.
            
          Advantages:-
            1. Reverting deployment way too easy. just attch the old EC2 with LB
            2. No capacity reduction 
          
          How New Instances are Created or Used:-
            There is two way for the new instance
            1. Use existing one:-
                The developer creat a instances MANUALLY and at the time of deployment he will give info about either its tag or ASG
                This is rarely used because it add the overhead task of creating the EC2 manually.
            2. Let Codedeploy create for you:-
                For this you must have the ASG. without ASG it will not work.
                Here you will give information about the ASG in deployment group. 
                later at the time of deployment the codedeploy agent will create a copy of that ASG with exactly same cofiguration 
                and create new instances in that ASG for you. then use those new instances foe new version and kill the older ones.
                This one is widely used. here you hjust have to set the proper ASG and codedeploy will do the rest.
            
  
  
  How to set the proper ASG for CodeDeploy:-
    Choose all that you want in your EC2's. 
    then add the proper 'user data' script as mentioned in #INSTCODEAG. That it.
    assign the LAM role as such that EC2 has full access of S3.
    so all the created instances in this ASG will have codedeploy agent preinstalled.
    
  Deployment Group:-
    Think of Dep Group as reusable deployment comfiguratiuion template which contain lot of config detail like, dep type, enviorment, 
    sucsses stratagy, LB detail, EC2 groups or tag, ASG etc.
    Once you created dep group with all this infor you can then for deployment you give two things
    1. The grouo that you wants to use
    2. The deployment bundle location 
  
  #CDCREATION
  Steps:-
    1. Create 2 IAM role one for Ec2 and one For CodeDeploy
    2. Launce the EC2's and
      - provide them the tag 'MufCodeDEployTag' so codedeploy later can idetify it for deployment
      - provide hime the role for EC2 created in step 1 [if you are using S3 for deploymeny ]
      - Install codedeploy agent on those EC2 as described in section #INSTCODEAG
          To do this Quickly you can provide this script in 'start script' at a time of launch configuration.
    3. Now create a S3 bucket where in you will upload your code and later codedeploy get it from here for EC2.
         - Do remember to enable the versioning in this bucket
    4. Now this is time to create a zip package of you deployment unble. create a Deploymet Bulble with must have 'appspec.yml' file
       with sourcvve code, scripts and resources etc. then upload thisZip in S3 bucket
       You can use below command to upload it or can do it via aws console.
        ???????????????    
    - Now at this point you have your deployment package ready in S3, our destination EC2 is running, everyone have all necessary roles,
      From here we will see the steps we need to take for deployment of it.      
      
    5. Create CodeDeploy Application
      go to   AWS > CodeDEploy > Deploy > Application > Create Application
          - Name of Application [say MufCodeDeploy]
          - Platform [EC2 in our case]          
     
    6. Create Deployment Group:
        6.1  AWS > CodeDEploy > Deploy > Application > MufCodeDeploy > Deployment Group > Create 
        6.2  choose name [say MufCodeDeployGroup]
        6.3  choose the service role we created in step 1 for CodeDeploy so that it can perform crtain task.
        6.4  Select Deployment Type
            - If you are deploying for the firset time then you shoulg choose the in-place deployment otherwise b\g
        6.5 Set Environment configuration:   
            Here you nned to specify that how CodeDeplot will idetify the EC2 for Deployment, this depend on hwhat deployment type you have choosen
            For 'In-Place': 
                If you choosed 'In Palce' there is two possible way to identify the candidate EC2
                  1. By Tags: you provide the tag here so that all the EC2 (aws/on-primises) with this Tag will be deployed with app version
                      he tag of EC2 in Step 2 'MufCodeDEployTag' must be same as the one here.
                      IMP:- only key of the Tag is compared the value is not required at all.
                  2. By AutoScalling Group: 
                      You must choose the ASG here
                      All the EC2 running in this ASG will be upgraded with new version.
             5.1A  Elect the ASG or EC2 tag of candidate instaces         
                  
            For 'BG':-
               As mentioned above that for BG you kill the existing instance of EC2 and create the new one.
               and there is two way to do this:-
               Manual:- 
                 In deploy-group you specify the tag or ASG of existing EC2 instances 
                 and before deployment you manually create the new EC2 instances(with tag 'mufNewInc') or new ASG ('mufNewAsg') 
                 and finally at a time of deployment you provide the info (TAg(mufNewInc) or ASG(mufNewAsg)) of new instances.
                 This is not at all recomendded as it onvolve manula process.
               
               Auto:-
                In deploy-group you specify the ASG(not tag) of existing EC2 instances.
                Now at a time of deployment
                The codedeploy agent create a copy of this ASG (you can see it in AWS console) with 100% same configuration of ASG mentioned above
                create new instances in that new ASG.
                
              5.1A Choose BG deployment type from Manual or Auto
                  5.1A1: For Manual-
                          ??????????????
                  5.1A2: For Auto-
                          Select the ASG from from which the older instances will be killed and by which a new copy of ASG will be created. 
                     
                
        6.6: Now choose how you consider the deployment as successful
              AllAtOnce:  
                  For In-Place: 
                    The deployment will happen on as many instance as possible at once.
                    deployment as success if all the EC2 deployment is successful at least on one instance, Fail otherwise
                  For BG: 
                    The deployment will happen on as many replacement-instance as possible at once.
                    Once finish with deployment traffic routing will happen to all intance together at once.
                    Succeeds if traffic is successfully rerouted to at least one instance, Fail otherwise
              HalfAtATime: 
                  For In-Place: 
                    The deployment will happen on half of instance at once.
                    succeeds if the application revision is deployed to at least half of the instances, Fail otherwise.
                  For BG:
                    The deployment will happen on half of replacement-instance at once.
                    Succeeds if rerouting to at least half of the instances succeeds, Fail Otherwise.
              OneAtATime: 
                For In-Place:-
                  Deploys the application revision to only one instance at a time.
                  succeeds if the application revision is deployed to all of the instances, Fail otherwise [exception if last instance fail then it still consider success]
                For BG:-
                  Deploys the application revision to only one replacement-instance at a time.
                  Succeeds if traffic is successfully rerouted to all replacement instances. Fails after the very first rerouting failure.
                      [exception if last instance fail to register for traffic then it still consider success]
               Custom:-
                You can set the percentage of instance to deploy at a time.

 
        6.7 LB:
          IF the EC2 are attached to any LB then select them, so that codedeploy can attach/dettach it while in deployment.
 
     7. Now finally Create deployment
        7.1  AWS > CodeDEploy > Deploy > Application > MufCodeDeploy > Create Deployment
        7.2  Select the deployment group created in step 6
        7.3  select thee source from S3 bucket and choose the bundle you uploaded to s3 
        Now you can see thst deployment is started and in aws cosole you can see its process.
     Done        
    So here the process is finished.
    
    SO notice here that 
    - The deployment group created in step 6 is reusable. if you created once then you can resue it again for next version of deployment
    - Step 7 is one time activity. you create a deployment and run it once for next release you have to re-create one more deployment.
    
    
    In the DodeDeploy you actully create a the app;ication and inside this application you can create diffrent deployment group
    later for actul deployment you can use those groups.

   ----------------
   Log fie location of CodeDployAgent:-
    var/logs/aws/code-deploy
       
       
----------------------------

Deploy on ECS cluster:-
  For this you have to select the type='ECS' when creating the CodeDeploy Application.
  Now in Code Deploy Group in that Application You should select the ECS cluster and Service.
---------------------------

Deploy on Lambda:-
  Code deploy not work very nicely with Lambda, but you can use 
  CodeBuild + SAM + CodeDeploy for better system.
  In CodeDeploy you set values via SAM template 'DeploymentPreference' in 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
  This are:-
    AutoPublishAlias 
    DeploymentPreference 
    Hooks 
  For detail see #lambda/SAM.txt  
  
       
----------------

Supported Deployment:-
  EC2.            inplace and BG
  On premise.     inplace
  ECS.            BG
  Lambda.         BG
        
        
-----------------

CodeDeploy and CloudWatch EventBridge:-
  CodeDeploy is heavily integrated with EventBridge, you can create Trigger lambda or anything to handle scenarion like deployment failed or etc.

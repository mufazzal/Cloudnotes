When it comes to encryption and decryption the KMS play the central role in AWS ecosystem.

The KMS is mpotre than just a primitive en-dc system. its a complete managed service.

Its so strongle integrated with other system that with just few setting you can use this to en-dc the file/dat/object of below items
  1. S3
  2. EBS
  3. RDS
  4. Elastic Transcoder
  
  All of them have few setting in their contextual page to enable disable the en-dc via KMS.
  
  Aprt from this tyhe KMS also provide the API ti do this operation. will see it later
  ??????????????????????
  
  
  The most imp thing in the for any key is to 
    - Who can manage it what level
    - Who can use it for en/dc

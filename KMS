When it comes to encryption and decryption the KMS play the central role in AWS ecosystem.

The KMS is mpotre than just a primitive en-dc system. its a complete managed service.

Its so strongle integrated with other system that with just few setting you can use this to en-dc the file/dat/object of below items
  1. S3
  2. EBS
  3. RDS
  4. Elastic Transcoder
  
  All of them have few setting in their contextual page to enable disable the en-dc via KMS.
  
  Aprt from this tyhe KMS also provide the API ti do this operation. will see it later
  ??????????????????????
  
  
 KMS uses key policy the decide rhe access level of any key. 
 you can use User and Role only to assign the permission not USER GROUP (Why? No one know)
 Therer is IMP permission in Key policy that you must provide
    1. Who can manage it what level
        Those who can edit/delet the key
    2. Who can use it for en/dc
        Those who can use this key for en/dc (but not able to delete or edit it)
    
  
  How to do the en/dc :-
    there is as usual three way
    1. By SDK
    2. By API
    3. BY AWS-CLI
    
    
  Before you do the en/dc by any of those three, the first thing you have too do is Authentication
  And for this either you use Role or IAM-User
    For this see #AWS_SDK_AUTHENTICATE in 'AWS JS SDK.txt'
